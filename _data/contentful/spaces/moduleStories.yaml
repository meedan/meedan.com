    body: "Meedan is pleased to welcome Cat Ho on board as our first Director of Business
      Development and Operations! Cat joins us after consulting with Meedan on business
      planning. The team appreciated her insights, rigor and conviviality during her
      time as a consultant, and we're thrilled to welcome her in a full-time role.\n\nAs
      Meedan grows and develops as an organization, we have recognized the increasing
      need for business development and business operations as a key function for
      our continued sustainability in addition to grants, program service fees and
      other sources of revenue.\n\nWe'll be hearing more about Meedan's business efforts
      in the near future. For now, learn more about Cat below:\n\n### 1. What brought
      you to Meedan?\n\n2019 was my first year an independent business consultant,
      and I met a ton of people along the way. One day, I ran into my friend [Aviv
      Ovadya](https://twitter.com/metaviv \"Aviv Ovadya's twitter\") at a coworking
      space in San Francisco. Aviv insisted that I meet Meedan because he thought
      the international mindset and global impact at the organization would be compelling
      for me – and he was right. (Thank you, Aviv!)\n\nIn addition, something about
      the people at Meedan – Tom, Ed, An – left a positive impression on me, and I
      decided intuitively that I should try to stay in touch. Several months later,
      I got to consult with the team on business planning, and this year, there was
      an opportunity for me to join full time. \n\nSpecifically, I’m excited about
      figuring out how our [Check product and technology](https://meedan.com/check
      \"Check product and technology\") gets further market adoption in a way that’s
      in line with Meedan’s mission and values. It’s going to require a lot of creativity
      and cross-functional collaboration. Recently, our participation in the [National
      Science Foundation’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/
      \"National Science Foundation’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program\")
      has led me to conduct dozens of research interviews to better understand our
      current and potential users, customers, and partners. I’m mostly accustomed
      to doing secondary market business analysis, so this primary research approach
      has been really fascinating, and I intend to continue incorporating it into
      the work I’m going to do to steer our ship through new waters.\n\n### 2. What
      has been your experience before you joined Meedan?\n\nMy business career has
      been driven largely by my love for languages and cultures, which has taken me
      to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and the US. My functions and
      industries have varied, but I really like people and processes: I’ve been a
      salesperson, a procurement consultant, a sales strategist, an operations manager,
      a freelance business strategy consultant, and an MBA admissions consultant.
      I’ve worked in the investment banking industry at [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers
      \"Lehman Brothers company history\"), management consulting at [Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/
      \"Kearney\"), and in big tech at Facebook.\n\nIn terms of formal education,
      I have an MBA from [The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/
      \"The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)\"), an MA in International
      Studies from [The Lauder Institute at UPenn](https://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/
      \"The Lauder Institute at UPenn\"), and a dual BS/BA in Business Administration/Linguistics
      from [University of California, Berkeley. ](https://www.berkeley.edu/ \"University
      of California, Berkeley. \")\n\nOne notable shift is that Meedan is my first
      time joining a nonprofit since I did a college internship at [The Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/
      \"The Long Now Foundation\") as a linguist, and I’m thrilled to be part of a
      team that thinks deeply about its impact on the world. \n\n### 3. Tell us about
      an exciting and insightful experience that has shaped your perspective and work.\n\nDuring
      my MBA, I did a summer internship in Bogotá, Colombia that really tested my
      high school and college Spanish language skills. I had so much fun being properly
      immersed in Spanish for the first time that I decided to pivot from my original
      plan to move to mainland China after graduation, and I moved to Latin America
      instead. \n\nIn my concurrent masters program in international studies, I was
      focused on East Asia and Chinese language. It ended up being fairly straightforward
      to walk away from my plan to move to China, because I realized that when I was
      in China, I would struggle to meet cultural expectations at work because I looked
      local, spoke like a local, but wasn’t really a local. \n\nEight years later,
      including three and a half years in Mexico and 11 visits to Brazil, I now like
      to say that I identify as Taiwanese American with a Latin soul. I think my own
      multicultural identity helps me see that people I work with can show up with
      very different cultural perspectives. As a people-loving person that actually
      enjoys work meetings a lot of the time, I like to think that my international
      experiences have given me additional tools for empathy that I can use to connect
      with and work better with people from all kinds of backgrounds. \n\n### 4. What
      opportunities do you see for business development across the range of disciplines
      that Meedan works in, such as technology, journalism and human rights work?\n\nFor
      me, business development is about growth through relationship building, whether
      that’s a sales relationship or a strategic partnership. I think Meedan already
      thoughtfully bridges organizations across these realms through large projects
      like Check Global and the 3PFC program on WhatsApp, but there’s room to do even
      more and cultivate our network of relationships so that we are poised to bring
      people together for exciting, cross-industry projects…but we won’t get there
      if we don’t first build trust with everyone that could be involved. So that
      brings me back to relationship building and finding exciting ways to collaborate,
      and I see a ton of opportunity to do so in every realm - technology, journalism,
      and human rights. \n\n### 5. Tell us some fun facts about Cat.\n\n- I have always
      hated pickles, but I’m trying to change this because I want to learn to enjoy
      all foods. I got over my distaste for mushrooms a few years ago, so I’m feeling
      optimistic.\n- Years ago while visiting the Canary Islands, I swing danced all
      over the island of Tenerife with my friend Oliver, and we made a [promotional
      swing dance video for the local dance scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yixyk8pN618
      \"promotional swing dance video for the local dance scene.\")\n- These days
      I’m an [aerialist and aspiring circus performer](https://www.instagram.com/avocircus/
      \"aerialist and aspiring circus performer\"), with a focus on aerial silks,
      aerial hoop, and juggling!"

    body: "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, [Meedan’s Digital Health Lab](https://meedan.com/digital-health-lab
      \"Meedan’s Digital Health Lab\") brought together a team of scientists to form
      [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/ \"Health Desk by Meedan's Digital Health
      Lab\"), a team tasked with supporting fact-checking organizations and journalists
      reporting on health misinformation about COVID-19. \n\nThe team launched what
      was then called learnaboutcovid19.org, a database of COVID-19 explainers, written
      by scientific experts on-demand. A couple of months later, we migrated to a
      new website and branded ourselves as “Health Desk” covering a wider range of
      questions about COVID-19 and other scientific topics related to public health.\n\n[Health
      Desk](https://health-desk.org/ \"Health Desk\") launched on April 15, 2021,and
      as of October 12 of this year more than 1.5 million people have visited health-desk.org.
      Over the last year and a half, the Health Desk team has been receiving health
      and science-related questions from journalism partners including [Africa Check](https://africacheck.org/
      \"Africa Check\"), [CITE](https://cite.org.zw/ \"CITE\"), [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/
      \"AFP Fact Check\"), [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/ \"Full Fact\"), [The

      a virtual help desk serving the Filipino community during COVID-19](https://www.tayohelp.com/hc/en-us
      \"Tayo, a virtual help desk serving the Filipino community during COVID-19\").\n\nIn
      December 2020, in collaboration with the [Australian Science and Media Centre](https://www.smc.org.au/
      \"Australian Science and Media Centre\") and a network of science media centres
      around the world, the [Vaccine Media Hub](https://health-desk.org/collection-projects/covid-vaccine-media-hub
      \"Vaccine Media Hub\") was launched, with the goal of specifically addressing
      questions related to COVID-19 vaccines. We launched this with the vision of
      scaling our support, providing direct access to quotes from scientists around
      the world about emerging COVID-19 vaccine-related research. These quotes, media
      briefings, and other important COVID-19 vaccine information are generated by
      scientists from the [Australian Science and Media Centre](https://www.smc.org.au/
      \"Australian Science and Media Centre\"), [Science Media Center Germany](https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/en
      \"Science Media Center Germany\"), [Science Media Centre New Zealand](https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/

      Desk and global science media centre teams continue to provide explainers, expert
      reactions and resources about globally circulating health misinformation during
      the pandemic. \n\nWhen Health Desk started these partnerships, we had a strong
      belief in the importance and the value of the content provided; however, we
      did not imagine how wide and diverse the audience would be. Our most frequently
      viewed explainers include: \n\n- [How do we know graphene oxide isn't used in

    body: "Meedan is excited to have Julissa Ayala, who goes by Juli, on board as
      our UX Designer! Learn more about Juli in the short Q&A below.\n\n### 1. What
      has been your experience before you joined Meedan?\n\nBefore Meedan, I had a
      diverse background that began with studying Psychology for undergrad in Florida,
      and upon graduating landing my first role as a [lead research assistant at Northeastern
      University](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/ap/research/ \"Department Of Applied
      Psychology Research Teams at Northeastern University\"). I conducted user interviews,
      synthesized data, and helped write grant proposals. I was interested in combining
      this experience with tech, so I transitioned to working on a Product team at
      [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ \"TripAdvisor\") conducting content
      QA, then later as a UX Designer for a health insurance exchange website operated
      by the US government, [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/ \"US Healthcare.gov\").\n\n###
      2. Tell us about an exciting and insightful experience that has shaped your
      perspective and work.\n\nDesigning for [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/
      \"US Healthcare.gov\"), whose users are of all ages, backgrounds, and varied
      needs, allowed me to develop an even deeper sense of empathy for the users I
      serve. I approached my work with the perspective to design for all users, keeping
      neurodiversity and accessibility top of mind. Products that are designed with
      this perspective make better products overall, because they’re more usable for
      everyone. \n\n### 3. What does the UX community think about designing for users
      across cultural contexts ? What are the strengths and what gaps do you see?\n\nAlthough
      in recent years it seems awareness is growing in designing for users across
      cultural contexts, on most fronts, we still have a long way to go. It seems
      that only very recently accessibility for users with special needs has been
      prioritized across the web, and as we learn more about this, it raises more
      questions about if we’re doing a good job designing for users of varied cultures,
      because one size does not fit all. When most of us think about designing across
      cultural contexts, what usually comes to mind is localization. This is an important
      piece, but we need to go deeper and think about things like imagery, icons,
      and communication styles. During my time at [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/
      \"US Healthcare.gov\"), I led several improvements to the Spanish version of
      the website that combined content strategy and UX. [In the US, Spanish is the
      most common non-English language spoken.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/09/05/what-is-the-future-of-spanish-in-the-united-states/
      \"Pew Research Center on Spanish being second most spoken language in US\")
      Now at Meedan, I’m thinking about the implications of designing on a more global
      scale, and how we can be more inclusive to all of our users.\n\n### 4. What
      brought you to Meedan?\n\nI was hoping to eventually shift gears to working
      in a smaller organization I could grow with and make a bigger impact. At the
      top of my list was also somewhere with a base of social good and great benefits.
      All of those boxes were checked when I came across a post on [Techqueria](https://techqueria.org/
      \"Techqueria\"), a Slack community for [Latinx](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a28056593/latinx-meaning/
      \"Latinx explained\") in tech, by Meedan’s Executive Associate, Gisela Zuniga.
      It was for an opening on Meedan’s product team, and I was immediately drawn
      in by Meedan’s ever so important mission of fighting global misinformation,
      particularly in the context of current events in 2021.\n\n### 5. What's a project
      you're excited about right now?\n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check \"Check
      by Meedan\"), Meedan’s fact checking platform has been my primary focus since
      I started at Meedan, and we’re making some really great improvements based on
      feedback from our newest users. It’s exciting to be able to contribute to the
      growth of such an important product on a global scale, being used by some of
      the world’s most well known companies and groundbreaking grassroots partners
      alike. My favorite part of making these improvements happen has been the discovery,
      where I get to talk to our users often and show them prototypes of what we’re
      working on. \n\n### 6. Tell us some fun facts about Juli.\n\n- I was born in
      the Dominican Republic, and although I grew up between Boston and Florida, I
      am privileged to be able to go back to my home country often and feel close
      ties to my family there and my roots.\n- I am the biggest [Tom Brady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady
      \"Tom Brady\") fan\n- I love listening to and dancing [bachata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCVQmEeBfbU
      \"bachata dancing\"), [merengue](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-merengue-music-and-dance
      \"merengue dancing\") and [salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_(dance)
      \"salsa dancing\")\n- I have an adorable Schnoodle named Melo who is very mellow\n\n![Juli’s

      organisations as well as the program team members. \n\n![Check Global Map](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3GxfE4iqCDEBGPdXiqahNu/5369a2a4777086d1285f65557ac8214a/CG_Screen_Grab_2.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Screen grab from the Check Global page showing the regions
      we are working in. </p>\n\nAs we complete ten years of Check Global’s work in
      2021, we’ve taken an opportunity to develop our theory of change for this decade
      and make plans for the next. The website section houses our theory of change
      and also shares resources in the form of toolkits, articles and research insights.
      \n\nAll the work shared on the website is published under open access licenses
      and is available for download. Our designers have ensured that the design is
      simple and there is ease of navigation. \n\nAs the Check Global section goes
      live, here are some reflections from the team members who contributed to this
      section. \n\n### Dima Saber, Program and Impact Director \nWhen we launched
      the current phase of the Check Global project in 2019, we started to discuss
      ways we could capture all the amazing work our program managers and partners
      have been doing across the North Africa Western Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
      America and the Asia Pacific regions. We spent a substantial amount of time
      working through many design iterations, templates, infographics, maps and posts;
      we found it tricky to capture over ten years of work in a responsive web page
      which would be easy and straightforward to navigate. We are today very proud
      of what we have been able to create, this section is indeed a labour of love!
      We hope you like it, and we hope it will get you excited about our work and
      our great network of partners. Please do get in touch and tell us what you think
      of what you see!  \n\n### Eric Mugendi, Program Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa
      \nHaving a dedicated Check Global section is a great opportunity to highlight
      not just the work that we do, but also the regions we have a presence in and
      what our respective partners are working on. This is a great opportunity not
      only to give them an additional platform to share their work with the world,
      but also to find potential partners in other parts of the world for potential
      collaborations and joint projects.\n\n![Check Global highlights from Latin American

      class=\"caption\">Screen grab showing highlights from our team and partners
      in Latin America.</p>\n\n### Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America
      \ \nIt's an amazing design effort to be able to capture the ten years of collaborations
      between our team and regional partners. The Check Global website was carefully
      created to communicate this work to our communities globally, and it showcases
      all of it in such a beautiful and informative way. It was a collective design
      in many ways, but its final form is a testimony to our design team's ability
      to organize multiple needs. Looking forward to seeing the next iterations of
      Check Global work and how it will be shaped here.\n\n### Shalini Joshi, Program
      Director, Asia Pacific \nThe Check Global website is our effort to share the
      program’s story from 2011 onwards. It’s a story that has been created by our
      partners and team members; a story presented by our design team. A story that
      we hope you’ll find interesting and inspiring. \n\n### Sneha Alexander, Program
      Associate, Asia Pacific \nThe Check Global website is a testimony to the amazing
      work the program team members and partner organizations have been doing in different
      regions over the last ten years. While thinking of how to best present the story
      of Check Global, we reflected upon our contribution in the years gone and the
      time ahead of us. And, the story is about inspiring each other, finding solutions
      to complex problems and working together to make a difference.\n\n### Kipp Jones,
      Designer\nPresenting a narrative that communicates to such a wide range of audiences,
      geographically and culturally, will always be a challenge. It has however been
      a real pleasure to collaborate on this new section of the website with the Check
      Global team. There was so much brilliant content for us to organise and visualise,
      reflecting the programs activities over the last decade.\n\n### Gisela Zuniga,
      Executive Associate\nWith our designer and Creative Director, I work informally
      as a Design Liaison for the rest of the Meedan team to project manage our internal
      creative work. Working collaboratively with the Check Global team to showcase
      their hard work over the years was so much fun to work on, as well as to integrate
      the collaborative nature of Check Global into the design through giving all
      of the amazing partnerships a big platform to shine.\n\nWe hope you will find
      the [Check Global section](https://meedan.com/check-global) on our website useful
      and will enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed working on it.\n"

    description: "Since 2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate
      the information bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and
      the journalism and fact-checking communities that need to get the information
      accurately and quickly.\n\nTo our community, we appreciate you, we are grateful
      for you, and our team of scientists is on-call for you as public health information
      response priorities shift and expand in 2021.   \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative."
    body: "To our incredible community of journalists, fact-checkers, podcasters,
      artists, and designers, and to the supporters that believed in the importance
      of collaborative responses to public health information inequities,\n\nThank
      you for making it possible to continue our public health response work. \n\nSince
      2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate the information
      bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and the journalism
      and fact-checking communities that need to get the information accurately and
      quickly. \n\nAs part of Meedan's Digital Health Lab, we are entering the second
      year of Health Desk project. Journalists and public health experts are continuing
      to work together in a time of crisis to get fast, reliable information to newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations around the world. With a rapid-response publishing
      process that borrows from two distinct industries—computer engineering and television
      news—our all-women team has written more than 200 explainers on COVID-19 topics
      for journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nIn local newsrooms from Delhi to Indianapolis,
      our work means that journalists do not have to scramble to find experts for
      comment every time COVID-19 news breaks. This alleviates an information bottleneck
      between critical emerging scientific research and public audiences that need
      to get the information accurately and quickly. \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative.
      For updates, check out [https://health-desk.org/vaccines/](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).
      \n\nWorking with you all over the last year has been an honor. The explainers,
      glossary terms and resources that our scientists have created to support communicators
      reaches audiences in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America. A sample content impact audit recently highlighted
      that 81% of the public health pieces that we have supported are on the front-page
      of Google search results for that topic in the region covered. That is such
      an essential metric as we think about the health information data voids that
      exist online, and how your work fills the information gaps that might otherwise
      largely contain problematic health misinformation.  \n\nWith a small team of
      scientists, researchers and communicators to influence diverse information spaces,
      these collaborations have shown the level of scale that can be made possible
      through syndication models for content dissemination, and strong collaborations
      across the public health and journalism fields. \n\nConversations with partner
      organizations have demonstrated how having access to experts can increase the
      subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and therefore the content available
      online to the fact-checkers’and journalists' audiences. How can we work together
      to continue to fill public health information gaps across a variety of topics,
      ranging from vaccinations to infectious disease, from nutrition to reproductive
      health care? \n\nAt a presentation our team participated in about health misinformation
      hosted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, health
      fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”, and
      this is in direct response to the public health efforts of innovative communicators
      around the world. This includes our amazing partners: VERA Files, India Today,
      Nigeria Health Watch, Speak Up Africa, Boom Live, Africa Check, Animal Politico,
      and many more. We're grateful for your dedication to untangling complex questions
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic, fact-checking in an era of evolving science
      and moments of uncertainty. Your response to the misinfodemic is vital.  \n\nWe
      have also started to serve local community media outlets in the United States,
      including public broadcasters such as the Atlanta NPR-affiliate, WABE, and Indianapolis’
      public radio station WFYI, as well as large media organizations like the New
      York Times and Reuters. Through a broader network of public broadcasters in
      the United States, called America Amplified, COVID-19 questions answered by
      Meedan scientists are brought to local audiences across the country. Our media
      partnerships also include Tayo Help Desk, a resource that offers American Filipinos
      localized insights into COVID-19 information. \n\nWe thank each and every one
      of the journalists, fact-checkers, and communicators that have come to us for
      support, and are looking forward to continuing collaborations in 2021. \n\nHere's

      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines
    body: "Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines thanks to a global
      alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s public health
      expert team, supported by the Google News Initiative.\n\nIn 2020 Meedan’s Digital
      Health Lab developed a [COVID-19 rapid information response initiative](https://health-desk.org/)
      to support our fact-checking and community media partners around the world,
      as they worked tirelessly to respond to COVID-19 misinformation. We were able
      to launch the initiative with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
      the Omidyar Network, and the Google News Initiative. In  2021, Meedan will be
      expanding the supported range of health topics as part of [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/),
      \ beginning with the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nOver the last year, the public health
      expert team working on Health Desk created a system for providing rapid responses
      to questions shared by fact-checkers, journalists, and other communicators around
      the world sharing vital COVID-19 information with different audiences. In response
      to health questions from fact-checkers and journalists (which you can always
      submit [here](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/ask-a-question), or via email directly
      to health@meedan.com), our team:\n\n- Reviews and summarizes the latest science
      for the topic that you are reporting on\n- Provides background and context for
      that topic as it relates to health research more generally, and\n- Gives you
      a list of important additional resources or sources you can review for your
      reporting or fact-checking\n\nBuilding off of this work, in partnership with
      the Australian Science Media Centre and their network of additional Science
      Media Centres around the world, the COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub will bring together
      multiple sources of evidence-based information on vaccines with material available
      in at least seven languages. The alliance will involve collaboration with organisations
      and experts from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
      region.\n\n“The threat of health misinformation has become a vector for the
      spread of infectious diseases and in the context of COVID-19, a  significant
      barrier to vaccine adherence. We see a networked approach to addressing information
      equity challenges as a critical public health need. With the global science
      community collaborating on providing fact-checkers and media partners with reliable,
      and time-sensitive health information that communicators can effectively report
      and respond to the vaccine information needs of their audiences. We are honored
      to work with the Australian Science Media Centre and their partner Science Media
      Centres on this critical initiative,” said Nat Gyenes, Director of the Meedan
      Digital Health Lab.\n\nThe media hub will include expert commentary and explainers
      that will help journalists and fact-checkers report on the science behind the
      COVID-19 vaccines being developed. \n\n“The COVID-19 vaccine development and
      roll-out are unprecedented. Fighting misinformation about this topic will require
      both targeting harmful hoaxes directly and supporting the crucial work of science
      beat reporters and fact-checkers informing the public. It is with this in mind
      that we’re thrilled to support the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub
      to help journalists access expertise rapidly and reliably”, said Alexios Mantzarlis,
      News and Information Credibility Lead, Google News Lab\n\n“The enormous impact
      of this pandemic has meant that scientists and pharmaceutical companies have
      had to go into overdrive to produce vaccines in record time. With so many vaccines
      in various stages of development, it can be very confusing for journalists and
      the public and this is where we hope to help,” said Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO
      of the AusSMC. “It’s now more critical than ever that we all have access to
      clear information about these vaccines as they are being developed”.\n\nIf you’re
      a fact-checker, journalist, community organizer or communicator working to respond
      to vaccine misinformation or strengthen vaccine adherence, and you’re interested
      in collaborating or learning more, please reach out to health@meedan.com, and
      check out our existing health information resources: [https://health-desk.org/](https://health-desk.org/),

    description: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance,
      the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool
      resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health
      emergencies in Africa.
    body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information
      since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been
      shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million
      times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African
      Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the
      United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.
      \n\nA large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and
      continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday.
      The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
      is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
      is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
      they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset
      of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies
      around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In
      health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to
      spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about
      their health and well-being, and a glut of information - an infodemic - with
      misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This
      crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop
      the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional
      Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the  Africa Infodemic Response Alliance
      \ will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines
      and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement
      efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.\n\nThe network is the
      first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional
      organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural
      science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect,
      disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.
      \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support
      journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based
      on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues. It also aims
      to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management
      strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists
      and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.\n\nThis
      initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that
      were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under
      the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe
      Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross
      and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the
      United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating
      and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check,
      PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
      public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
      for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
      ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
      can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab."

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America__, with localization of both text and accompanying
      visuals (thanks, to [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)

      using Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough
      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals

      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

    body: "Most of us go online every day to read the news, interact with others via
      social media, gather information, and make household purchases. Global technology
      giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and others influence
      what we see online, the sites we visit, and how we interact with content. They
      can also impact how we make decisions about our health. \n\nGlobal technology
      and social media companies represent a gap in what public health experts call
      the commercial determinants of health. Companies in agriculture, energy and
      other fields market their products, lobby governments, make displays of social
      responsibility, and maintain a massive global presence. Through these avenues,
      they have the power to impact health-related decision-making at the individual,
      household, community, national, and international levels. \n\nUnlike other organizations,
      tech companies employ complex algorithms, cross-platform advertising, and hosted
      content that shape what users’ [see online ](https://repository.kisti.re.kr/bitstream/10580/13511/1/Zimmer_Scheibe_Stock_Stock_v7n2_40-53.pdf)based
      on their behavior and engagement patterns. Of course, not all of the information
      online is factual;it may be true, partially true, or false. Tech tools create
      [echo chambers](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/9/e2023301118) that reinforce
      and bolster users’ existing beliefs and biases and foster continued online engagement.
      \nTech companies profit by [holding users' attention](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/social-media-companies-profiting-misinformation),
      using ads to sponsor [websites](https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-advertising-on-covid-19-misinformation/)
      that spread misinformation, which can involve, in some cases,  [hosting content](https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_6910f8ab94a241cfa088953dd5e60968.pdf)
      from “anti-vaxx” and other conspiracy theory groups. \n\nOur health is affected
      by where we live, the food we eat, how much money we have, access to health
      services, and who is part of our social networks. However, these social determinants
      of health fail to holistically include the online ‘infosphere’, as I shared
      in a [blog post](https://meedan.com/blog/information-as-a-social-determinant-of-health/)
      in April. \n\nResearch has shown that online content can influence [decision-making](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0747563217303357),
      [local cultures](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52249-0_33),
      [body image](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)30110-1/fulltext),
      lifestyle choices, and health habits, especially for individuals with low levels
      of health literacy. And when we consider how the quality, accuracy, accessibility,
      and availability of information can impact our health, we must also acknowledge
      that commercial influencers shape the information we see and how we receive
      it. Commercial entities wield a tremendous amount of power over how we make
      health-related decisions. \n\nCommercial determinants of health are commonly
      [defined as](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.12118) “factors
      that influence health which stem from the profit motive.” Historically, public
      health work and research in this space has [focused](http://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-017-0255-3)
      on how companies sell products (including highly-processed foods, beverages,
      alcohol, and tobacco) that contribute to early mortality and diseases including
      obesity, cancer, and type-2 diabetes. \n\nAdditional studies have explored [commercial
      interests](https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00607-x)
      that negatively impact health through contributions to environmental pollution,
      pesticide and chemical exposure, poor access to safe living conditions, and
      unequal access to medications and health services. \n\nWhile there are efforts
      to foster corporate accountability and engagement in health promotion activities,
      there is a longstanding tension between the public health community and private
      sector players. The commercial determinants of health present a considerable
      challenge that requires cross-sectoral collaboration and innovative partnerships.
      While companies often favor [personal responsibility](http://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-017-0255-3)
      over regulatory or policy interventions, [multisectoral engagement](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/371435/multisectoral-report-h1720-eng.pdf)
      across economics, finance, policy, research, healthcare, social sciences, public
      health, and others is vital. \n\nIn the tech sector, broad, coordinated policy
      actions have not been taken to improve the quality of health content, though
      some companies are actively working to improve health content on their individual
      platforms by implementing their own policies, strengthening content moderation
      and fact-checking practices, and redeveloping algorithms. For example, in an
      industry first, on July 1, 2021, [Pinterest banned ads](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-embraces-body-acceptance-with-new-ad-policy)
      containing weight loss-related products, images, or language in response to
      a rise in disordered eating habits and conditions over the past year.\n\nUnfortunately,
      there is not a singular response or “quick fix” solution to addressing the commercial
      determinants of health across sectors, and [additional research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757975920931249)
      is needed to further define and understand how these factors impact health.
      Furthermore, we must acknowledge tech companies as unique entities in commercial
      determinants of health models since search engines, social media companies,
      messaging platforms, and online advertising engines do and will continue to
      influence the health infosphere."

    body: "As the Taliban take over Afghanistan and establish their reign, there are
      questions about how the group will govern the country, and what this means for
      human rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and for women in Afghanistan.
      Women journalists are [at high risk in the country](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/12/afghanistan-female-journalists-rukhshana-media-sexism-taliba)
      and with the [Taliban attacking the press and women journalists](https://cpj.org/2021/08/taliban-take-2-female-state-tv-anchors-off-air-in-afghanistan-beat-at-least-2-journalists/),
      there are heightened concerns about their [promise to respect women’s rights
      and their statements encouraging women to return to work](https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-kabul-1d4b052ccef113adc8dc94f965ff23c7).
      \n\nEven before the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021, [the group has targeted
      women in the media in Afghanistan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/01/afghanistan-taliban-target-journalists-women-media&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631009254382000&usg=AOvVaw00dA0p5e7C2-tJibOJMp-P).
      Media workers have felt unsafe and, as a result, have practiced self-censorship,
      quit work or have faced violent consequences. Women journalists have  challenged
      the perceived social expectation  that women should not work in public domains
      in Afghanistan. As a result they have been attacked - therefore, [some women
      journalists have left Afghanistan](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/a-trailblazing-afghan-female-journalist-has-now-fled-the-country-like-millions-of-people-i-fear-the-taliban/articleshow/85769699.cms).
      \n\nWomen journalists from Afghanistan have spoken out against the Taliban regime.
      A TV presenter who was denied access to her workplace has [called on the international
      community to help](https://news.sky.com/video/afghanistan-female-presenter-claims-she-was-told-she-cannot-work-by-taliban-12384696),
      saying \"our lives are under serious threat\". [Another woman journalist told
      a media agency](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/we-see-silence-filled-with-fear-female-afghan-journalists-plead-for-help),
      \"For many years, I worked as a journalist to raise the voice of Afghans, especially
      Afghan women, but now our identity is being destroyed and nothing has been done
      by us to deserve this.\"\n\nThe [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/)
      stands in solidarity with all women journalists in Afghanistan, who are being
      targeted because of their work. \nWe urge democratic governments to facilitate
      emergency visas to Afghan women journalists  and their dependents who wish to
      leave or are under threat and provide safe passage out of the country. \nWomen
      journalists, both inside and outside the country, need mental health support
      and opportunities to work, share their experiences and continue to report in
      their own voices. We also urge newsrooms, civil society organizations, the international
      community and human rights groups to support their needs in whichever ways possible,
      including ongoing media pressure in both independent and mainstream, localised
      and global coverage of the new Taliban regime. \nWomen journalists who are under
      attack need our support in digital security practices and tools. Resources in
      local languages and support from experts in digital security is also urgently
      required. We urge social media platforms to roll out security features to protect
      the identities of those who could be targeted through their social media profiles
      and other online information.\n\nThe Check Global Network is committed to supporting
      and strengthening the work of women journalists and media professionals from
      Afghanistan. We are a community that brings together civil society groups and
      newsrooms working in the area of independent media and information creation
      in different regions, including Central and South Asia. As a network, we will
      continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan closely and extend our support
      to interventions designed to support women journalists from the country. \n\nTo

      \n\n__Dima Saber, Check Global Program Director__\n\nThere are a few women who
      I turn to - in my own little mind - for inspiration and a confidence boost when
      things get bad in the many countries where we work as part of the Check Global
      project; Maria Ressa is at the top of that list. You know how you tend to over-idealise
      people whose work you respect so deeply, that it seems almost impossible for
      you to imagine a situation where you are actually face-to-face (well, at least
      virtually) with them, asking them questions, and enjoying every bit of their
      responses? Well, this is exactly how it felt when I was given the opportunity
      to [interview](https://meedan.com/blog/watch-reporting-barriers-during-covid-19-with-maria-ressa/)
      Maria Ressa for a Check Global network event back in May 2020, for a whole 52
      minutes and 22 seconds! I found myself in front of a kind, inspiring, humble,
      generous, and extremely sharp woman who is today leading the way to #HoldTheLine
      against oppression, despotism, propaganda and disinformation in the Philippines,
      and beyond it, across our emerging economies. The news of Maria Ressa winning
      the Nobel Peace Prize felt personal; as if someone very close to me has accomplished
      something great. It also made me realise that the struggles of all the journalists,
      activists, archivists and human rights defenders - the imprisoned, the disappeared
      and those still fighting for the same ideas and ideals as Ressa - are seen,
      legitimised and recognised, and this realisation is probably one of the best
      and most comforting things that's happened in 2021! \n\n__Isabella Barroso,
      Program Manager - Latin America__\n\nAbout 10 years ago when I left my career
      in journalism to work in technology, a lot of the reasoning at the time was
      based in fear. The type of investigative practice I admired and dreamed of working
      with was dangerous, and in some cases even deadly in Latin America. Fear stopped
      not only me but also a dozen of other colleagues from pursuing our objectives.
      At the time I had a teacher that used to say that good journalism cannot be
      based only on awards, she was, in her own way, saying that  are more journalists
      creating astounding and essential political work everyday, than awards to give
      them. In that sense, the award to Maria Ressa is also a way to recognize the
      work of many others fighting to uphold truth in a polarized world. This award
      will be a beacon of hope, and of inspiration to women journalists everywhere.
      It whispers: if you stay true, even though it won’t be safe for a while yet,
      your work can be a light for others. I forwarded the news of this award to a
      few of my old classmates, and we all shared a moment of pure happiness,  not
      only for her, but also for the future of women journalists and activists everywhere;
      may they follow Maria Ressa’s light, and never give up. \n\n__Jenna Sherman,
      Program Manager, Digital Health Lab__\n\nMaria Ressa’s Nobel Prize signifies
      to me the criticality of fighting for truth and just how high the stakes are
      of doing so. We strive to integrate Maria’s fervent commitment to objectivity
      and human rights into our every day work at Meedan, using that spirit to guide
      work that is often difficult and during circumstances that are often dark. As
      a public health practitioner working with journalists and fact-checkers to provide
      high quality health information to the public — particularly those who need
      it most — it can sometimes feel daunting and exhausting to keep up the work
      amidst significant misinformation, disinformation, and harassment. I’m so deeply
      grateful to have joined a team where from the very top, our managers are unwavering
      in their beliefs in information quality and equity being cornerstones of a better,
      more peaceful world, and am able to tap into that belief any time I start to
      feel weary.\n\n__Nat Gyenes, Program Director, Digital Health Lab__\n\nMaria
      Ressa is a role model for what it means to be courageous, to be determined,
      to dedicate the time needed to create a meaningful change in a challenging,
      broken system. So much of the work that our team has developed is inspired by
      Maria’s dedication, commitment to truth and the fight towards a better future:
      where power comes with accountability, especially in our information ecosystem.
      Our team of public health researchers has been working tirelessly over the last
      year and a half to support challenges in information equity related to both
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and all of the public health issue areas disproportionately
      affected or left under-resourced as a result of the pandemic. Working with journalists
      to ensure that the latest evidence is reflected in accurate reporting is an
      ongoing challenge as the evidence itself continues to evolve, but it is an essential
      component of sustaining trust in reliable and relevant health information. Of
      course, this is just one part of the broader challenge, where political and
      other power incentives and disinformation further exacerbate the challenges
      of information inequity. Maria serves as a leader and inspiration for Meedan’s
      theory of change, and for the values that inform our work and our mission, where
      we prioritize our responsibility to supporting truth. This award is so, so well
      deserved, and is an important milestone in the global recognition that an obstruction
      of truth is an obstruction of peace. \n\n__Shalini Joshi, Program Director -
      Asia Pacific__\n\nAs a woman journalist in India, I've always looked up to Maria
      Ressa as a torchbearer for freedom of expression and rights of other women journalists
      in the region. While women journalists are attacked, harassed, abused and maligned
      across Asia Pacific and in other regions, Maria shows us how to take on injustice
      and call out oppressors with courage and defiance. Maria Ressa being awarded
      the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize gives us hope that the fight for truth, facts and
      democracy is being recognised, upheld and validated.  \n\nAs a Check Global
      team member, I've had the honour and privilege of interacting with Maria on
      a few occasions; her energy, humility and wittiness in all conversations make
      the darkest of days seem brighter. These are grim times for journalists across
      Asia, however, meetings with Maria fill me with hope and optimism. I consider
      her to be a mentor, leading the way with her charismatic presence, dynamism
      and her brilliant tools of investigative journalism. I am incredibly proud of
      our partnership with Rappler and Maria Ressa. There can be no one more deserving
      of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n__Sneha Alexander, Program Associate - Asia
      Pacific__\n\nAs a Meedani, I have heard a lot about Maria Ressa, but have met
      her only once, in a virtual meeting. That left a lasting impression. The passion
      with which she spoke about the upcoming project that Rappler will lead in the
      Philippines was absolutely inspiring. It puts into perspective the importance
      of the work we are doing as part of the Check Global program along with a global
      network of journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nWhile speaking truth to power
      can be a solitary journey, Ressa highlights the importance of supporting and
      collaborating with each other across our respective networks   to deliver the
      hard hitting truth. If one falls, there should always be others to carry forward
      the task of speaking to power. It was the work of brave and committed journalists
      in India that drove me towards journalism in the early phase of my career. Listening
      to her, I was convinced that every young journalist should know about Maria
      Ressa and her work, and have the  chance to interact with her.  \n"

    description: In November 2021, VERA Files, our Check Global partner in the Philippines
      launched VERA, the first public misinformation tipline on Viber in the Asia
      Pacific region. Integrated with Check, Meedan's platform for verification and
      annotation, VERA, the truth bot, guides users through the tipline. As the May
      2022 presidential election nears in the  Philippines, there is more false and
      misleading information on popular messaging platforms like Viber. This is why
      VERA Files Fact Check introduced VERA, a bot that can be Viber users'friend
      and ally in fighting disinformation and misinformation. The Check Global team
      interviewed team VERA Files to learn more about the tipline and the response
      from Viber users.

      partner in the Philippines launched [VERA](https://chats.viber.com/verafiles),
      the first public misinformation tipline on Viber in the Asia Pacific region.
      Integrated with [Check](https://meedan.com/check), Meedan's platform for verification

      and ally in fighting disinformation and misinformation. The [Check Global](https://meedan.com/check-global)
      team interviewed the VERA Files team to learn more about the tipline and the
      response from Viber users.\n\n__Why and when did you choose to launch a tipline
      on Viber?__ \n\nWe launched our misinformation tipline on Viber in November
      2021, which is six months before the Philippines’ upcoming presidential elections
      in May 2022.\n\nIn 2020, VERA Files did a social media analysis and found an
      opportunity to enter the dark social space. Dark social refers to private channels
      such as instant messaging apps and email where people interact in twos or in
      groups.\n\nDuring the pandemic we saw an increase in the use of these private
      channels, such as governments and health agencies utilizing the space to reach
      the public. At the same time, disinformation and misinformation increasingly
      thrived in communities on dark social. This then became a space for fact checkers
      to also be in.\n\nWe thought that VERA Files going into dark social could help
      fight the lies by bringing facts to light, while also involving our subscribers
      in the process. We crowdsource leads for content that need fact checking, and
      if the tip is verifiable, VERA Files sends the requesters a bite-sized fact
      check that they can also share or forward to their communities.\n\n__What was
      the process of setting-up the tipline like? What steps did you take?__\n\nOne
      of our editors Charmaine Deogracias, who also wears the hat of being our social
      media management expert, calls our process a three-pronged approach: it involved
      the strategy, decision and will to actually set up the tipline.\n\nAfter identifying
      the opportunity to go into dark social, we set up a Viber community. It was
      launched in July 2021 by publishing in this space our live fact checks on President
      Rodrigo Duterte’s state of the nation address at the time. We earned a lot of
      subscribers during this event.\n\nThe first step to this was getting a verifiable
      business phone number registered under the VERA Files name with a telecommunications
      provider that best fit our needs. The process took about two weeks. This was
      the same amount of time it took for us to coordinate with Viber and get our
      Community a verified status.\n\nWe then got in touch with Meedan to help set
      up our misinformation tipline. They provided us with the infrastructure to set
      up a user-friendly interface on Viber, as well as an online workspace that receives
      all the requests. The messaging was personalized by VERA Files and tweaked to
      fit the features we wanted the tipline to have.\n\nAt the moment, our tipline
      subscribers can choose to do the following: 1) send a tip for fact checking,
      2) subscribe to VERA Files’ weekly Viber newsletter, and 3) learn how to fact
      check.\n\nOur belief is that everybody can and should be a fact checker. By
      setting up a tipline with these features, we’re working toward our goal of encouraging
      readers to practice the habit of verification and empowering them to fact-check.\n\nWe
      also discovered a special talent of one of our reporters, Klaire Ting, in illustration.
      It was she who gave the face to VERA the truth bot, which guides our subscribers
      through the tipline.\n\nWith a little more coordination with Viber, we were
      able to integrate VERA the truth bot into our Viber community which made it
      easier for subscribers to access the tipline through a nifty little bot button
      in the community’s menu. The setting up of the tipline from start to launch,
      including two testing phases, took about two months total.\n\n__What has been
      the response to the Viber tipline?__\n\nThe response to the tipline has been
      very warm since its launch and we currently have over 170 subscribers. \n\nOur
      misinformation tip line is the first of its kind on Viber in the Asia Pacific
      region, and we are very glad to put some eyes and ears on this space to encourage
      a more fact-based online environment.\n\n__Currently what kind of messages are
      users sending to the tipline?__\n\nOur tipline subscribers send a variety of
      fact check requests covering politics to vaccines to COVID-19 and social aid.
      It has been interesting to see the types of content that users send for fact
      checking as it paints a picture of the kind of misinformation and disinformation
      circulating in dark social. They send photos and text-based requests, but there
      are also a lot of submissions involving links to Facebook posts, YouTube videos
      and website articles.\n\n__What is the format of responses being sent to users,
      for example, are they mostly visual responses or text-based responses?__\n\nWe
      send out both a text-based and visual response to eligible fact check requests.
      \n\nIt’s useful to send out both to serve different purposes. The text-based
      responses have a little more information and it also carries the link to the
      relevant fact check article. But we find value in publishing a visual format
      as well because we’ve noticed in our other social media channels that people
      interact more with posts that carry a visual asset. \n\nThe art card may be
      something that readers would be more enticed to forward to their family and
      peers, there is also that element of recognition because the art card carries
      a screenshot of the post we are fact checking.\n\n__What are your plans for
      the tipline for 2022?  __\n\nCurrently in the pipeline for 2022 is to promote
      the use of the tipline in Filipino communities overseas, such as workers and
      students who often keep in touch with their families at home through dark social.
      For context, there are an estimated 2.2 million overseas Filipino workers.\n\nThis
      journey begins with our partnership with [Taiwan FactCheck Center](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/)
      to encourage the use of the tipline among the Filipino communities in Taiwan.\n\nThis
      is a critical time for us to cultivate the habit of fact-checking: apart from
      the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic, there is also much online disinformation
      concerning the 2022 Philippine elections.\n\nWe also plan to improve our response
      times to the fact-check requests that we receive. Having limited manpower, one
      of our pain points is responding promptly to user submissions.\n"
