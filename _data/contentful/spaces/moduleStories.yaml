      \n\nIn this blogpost, we speak to [Enock Nyariki](https://twitter.com/enocknyariki),
      Managing Editor of PesaCheck about the organization's strategies and experience
      of combating misinformation in Africa.\n\n__1. You work in over 10 countries
      of East and West Africa. What are the main sources of misinformation in the
      region and what are your strategies to address them?__\n\nWe find misinformation
      across social media platforms. Facebook is the most popular social platform
      in most of the countries that we operate in and we tend to find posts containing
      misinformation on it. We debunk the claims contained on these posts and publish
      articles on our site pesacheck.org. \n\nWhatsApp users also share posts they
      have seen going round on social media on our WhatsApp tipline number (+254707813834)
      for us to verify. \n\n__2. You run WhatsApp tiplines in multiple languages.
      How challenging has this been to set up?__\n\nThe tipline is currently set up
      for English, French, Kiswahili and most recently Amharic. We have menus in various
      languages, and the prompt sent to the user allows them to choose the language
      of response. \n\nWe already have a team working in different languages which
      allows us to respond to all the submissions that come to the tipline. We have
      been educating users on how the tipline operates to ensure they are sharing
      claims correctly and also the scope of claims we can look into. \n\nThe tipline
      sometimes receives submissions that are incomplete or outside our verification
      scope. We share our methodology with the users, allowing them to know what can
      and what cannot be fact-checked.\n\n__3. How have you been able to address COVID-19
      related misinformation in the region over the past year? Has misinformation
      thwarted efforts to keep people safe?__\n\nWe have debunked hundreds of claims
      touching on COVID-19 and vaccines in the past year. Our approach has been to
      prioritize such misinformation, because of the danger it poses to members of
      the public. We are part of the founding members of the [Africa Infodemic Response
      Alliance](https://www.afro.who.int/aira) (AIRA), which has helped connect our
      fact-checkers with the WHO and CDC, helping us to debunk claims faster.\n\n__4.
      You have been using Check to support your WhatsApp tipline and to manage your
      editorial workflow? Could you elaborate more on both the use cases? How have
      you been able to integrate Check into your work?__\n\nWe use Check to manage
      submissions that we receive through our tiplines, and the main function of this
      is to automate responses to user submissions. The system allows us to match
      claims submitted to fact-checks fast through automatic and manual matching of
      similar items based on content that we have already checked. When a submission
      is similar to a claim that we have already debunked, the system sends out an
      automated response, removing the need for manual generation of user reports
      every time we receive the same claim. \n\nSince we operate in multiple languages,
      we are currently adapting our workflow on Check to manage the editorial processes.
      For content that needs translation, we have created folders where translators
      and  to editing and earmarking for publication. Through Check we can track the
      process and see who completed what stage of the copy flow process. The folders
      allow us to keep the languages separate which is essential as we have six languages
      in which we operate.\n\n__5. What are your plans to promote the tipline in the
      country and to widen your audience in the region?__\n\nWe plan to create awareness
      around the tipline in the 12 countries that we cover, and in multiple languages.
      At the moment, most claims are in English, and they come from Kenya and Uganda.
      We intend to promote the tipline in French, Kiswahili, Amharic, Afaan Oromo
      and Tigrinya.\n\n__6. You conduct media literacy and fact-checking training
      in universities of the region and support media and NGOs to establish their
      own standalone fact-check teams. How successful is this in combating misinformation
      in the region?__ \n\nIt's super-important, because combating misinformation
      requires collaboration. No one fact-checking organization can succeed in fighting
      the information disorder alone. We have helped set up [CheckDesks](http://skyfm.co.ke/podcast/8591/)
      in tens of newsrooms, which have [produced](https://businesstoday.co.ke/bill-gates-neither-funded-nor-planned-covid-19-pandemic/)
      hundreds of[ fact-checks](https://pigafirimbi.africauncensored.online/alleged-covid-19-deaths-vaccine-norway/).
      We also train journalism students at universities such as Daystar University
      and Aga Khan University in Nairobi, and we do this in order to nurture future
      journalists to incorporate fact-checking in their day-to-day reporting. We are
      also working with media lecturers to include fact-checking courses in their
      curricula."

      In India, vaccine hesitancy poses a risk to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. According to latest figures shared by the [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), 342 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine and 93 million have been fully vaccinated until July 26, 2021. That's about 25% and 6% of the population in India, respectively.  Wide variations in the vaccination strategy across states are keeping India from achieving a desirable vaccination rate.  [Supply shortages i](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-daily-covid-19-infections-rise-by-38949-2021-07-16/)n many states have left millions of people vulnerable to the virus. In addition to vaccines running out, fears and rumours about the vaccine have resulted in delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination. Misinformation on social media and messaging platforms about the vaccine causing infertility, serious side effects or even death has been circulating widely even before the vaccination programme rolled out in the country. Other reasons for refusal of vaccines include  disbeliefs among people that coronavirus is spreading  in their area and that they can be infected by the virus.

       [The Covid Symptom Survey (CSS)](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/india-has-a-vaccine-hesitancy-challenge-7388907/) reveals that the proportion of the population hesitant to Covid vaccines is highest in Tamil Nadu (40 per cent), Punjab (33 per cent), Haryana (30 per cent), Gujarat (29 per cent), and Andhra Pradesh (29 per cent). The digital divide that exists in the country has also exacerbated the problem. The vaccine registration process involves the use of smartphones and the internet, and a lot of people across the country do not have access.

      This blogpost captures the views of editors of [Ekta consortium ](https://ekta-facts.com/)about the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in India and their response to the challenge. The Ekta consortium has been formed by six independent fact-checking groups in India: [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/), [BOOM Live](https://www.boomlive.in/), [Factly](https://factly.in/), [India Today Fact Check](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check), [Vishvas News](https://www.vishvasnews.com/) and [WebQoof](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof). All the groups are part of Facebook's third-party fact-checking program, and Meedan has provided access to its fact-checking platform Check and strategic support for this project.

      __1.  Where are you seeing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccine?__

      __Social media platforms and messaging apps contribute to the spread of misinformation but so do influencers and self-proclaimed doctors.__

      __Rakesh Dubbudu, Editor, Factly:__ Social media content including unscientific/magical cures, conspiracy theories, rumours, fake news by so-called experts/cons have been circulating on closed groups like WhatsApp & shared on platforms like Facebook & YouTube. Misinformation in rural areas is spread through word-of-mouth or people's past experiences of vaccination. Some people also have a sense of invincibility and they believe that Covid won't affect them.

      __Shachi Sutaria, Fact-checker, Journalist- Health, BOOM:__ This can be seen on social media channels such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook. A section of medical practitioners and quacks are perpetuating their videos through Telegram.

      __Kritika Goel, Associate Editor, WebQoof:__ Other than WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Telegram, we have seen politicians, self-proclaimed doctors and quacks promoting conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 and vaccines. Some of the groups on these social media platforms use different words or short forms to escape the algorithm. We have seen politicians openly promoting "cures" which are not backed by science or evidence.

      __2.  What kind of misinformation has been circulating around on the COVID-19 vaccine? Can you share some examples?__

      __Serious side effects, death, misinformation related to the vaccine containing items that are prohibited in certain religions and other conspiracy theories have been doing the rounds online and off.__

      __Shachi Sutaria:__  [Death due to vaccination](https://www.boomlive.in/coronavirus-outbreak/fact-check-luc-montagnier-nobel-covid-vaccine-die-in-two-years-13278) and post COVID-19 vaccination side effects are the biggest drivers of vaccine hesitancy. Reports of the body becoming magnetic post vaccination, or people developing different diseases, the vaccine containing cow serum, aborted fetal cells, aluminium are driving vaccine hesitancy. Misinformation such as the vaccines containing microchips and collecting personal data, vaccines altering human DNA, are also doing the rounds.

      __Rakesh Dubbudu:__ The spectrum of misinformation ranges from questioning the vaccine ingredients such as [cow serum](https://factly.in/bharath-biotechs-covaxin-does-not-contain-newborn-calf-serum/), pig fat, aluminum, etc., vaccines affecting menstrual cycle/causing infertility, homemade concoctions to either cure or prevent Covid-19 instead of vaccinations, government implanting microchips through the vaccine, magnetic effects at the site of injection to death within 2 years after the vaccine.

      __Kritika Goel:__ From vaccines containing chips to control people to vaccines causing death, all these unfounded theories have contributed to vaccine hesitancy in the country. A lot of people have been made to believe that the vaccines will make them "[magnetic](https://fit.thequint.com/fit-webqoof/covid-19-vaccine-magnetic)", will make them infertile, that the vaccine contains cow serum and pig fat. Some posts also claim that the vaccine is the reason behind the new variants and the subsequent waves.

      __Uzair Rizvi, Fact checker, AFP Fact Check:__ Misinformation surrounding death, impotence, [menstrual issues in women,](https://factcheck.afp.com/false-posts-claim-womans-menstrual-cycle-affects-efficacy-covid-19-vaccination) and other health issues related to vaccines are floating widely on social media. There's also content like vaccines making the body magnetic, or containing microchips to track people's movements.

      __Chayan Kundu, Senior Journalist, India Today Fact Check:__ The main misinformation is death due to vaccination, then comes misinformation about vaccines having microchips, magnets, [vaccines being a strategy for population control ](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/no-scientific-evidence-of-covid-vaccination-causing-infertility-in-men-women-says-health-ministry-1817696-2021-06-21)and conspiracy theories like connection between the vaccine lobby and the Wuhan lab and misinformation related to pregnancy.

      __3.  In your understanding, what are the main reasons for vaccine hesitancy among people?__

      __Kritika Goel:__  The Quint conducted a survey in the rural areas of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar and we found that misinformation was one of the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy. A lot of people are made to believe through WhatsApp forwards that vaccines will actually kill them and that is what is making them hesitant. As per our understanding, it is also because of lack of awareness, communication and information which is given to them. In a few cases, we have found that people in villages don't even know about the existence of Covid vaccines.

      __Rakesh Dubbudu:__ Unverified sources actively spreading Covid-19 misinformation and a huge lack of procedural awareness in terms of registration & administration have been reasons for hesitancy. Given the timelines of vaccine research and how rushed the process was, there is low trust in the safety & efficacy of the vaccine. Finally some people also have choice anxiety in terms of waiting for a specific vaccine & concerns around safety of vaccination centers. 

      __Chayan Kundu:__ The Covid vaccines have been made within a very short span of time, much less than the usual time it takes to create a vaccine with proper trials, there is hesitancy from the very beginning about its efficacy and its side effects in the long run.

      __Shachi Sutaria:__ Health and science are topics which are continuously evolving and the latest updates have to be effectively communicated to the community at large. In reality, there is lack of access to updated health information, spread of misinformation through quacks, anecdotes of pain post vaccination and reports of  people still getting infected as well deaths post vaccination; all these are exacerbating the existing vaccine hesitancy. 

      __Uzair Rizvi:__ Some of the misinformation is being floated by doctors themselves on their YouTube channels or on social media where they talk about unproven side-effects; this discourages people from taking vaccines. 

      __4.  Given that there is a digital divide in our country, what steps can be taken to ensure the most marginalised can access information related to vaccines. What out of these is your group focusing on/ plans to focus on?__

      __Chayan Kundu:__ Door to door campaign by the health workers. Political leaders, councilors, local panchayats should be part of this campaign. Rolling out information on social media particularly on WhatsApp, facebook to counter misinformation.

      __Kritika Goel:__ We have been working with three local news organisations in UP, MP, Bihar and Assam to be able to reach out to the rural audience and ensure that they have access to fact-checked and verified information. We try to gather misinformation which is doing the rounds in their circles so that we can debunk it and bring forth the facts. We are also creating awareness videos to tell our audience about the importance of vaccines and debunk the myths around Covid-19. All this content is being produced in local languages to make it more accessible to the reader. We are writing text pieces, producing animated and stand up videos, creating cards (templates that can be shared over WhatsApp). We also aim to produce some jingles and do skits so that we are able to connect with the audience better. Some of this content that we are producing is also being published on local websites and being aired by local channels.

      __Shachi Sutaria:__ Along with writing regular stories debunking misinformation as well as explaining different health and scientific terminologies and reports, BOOM has also been conducting workshops with senior citizens in multiple languages to help them discern their way through the information overload during Covid-19 times.

      The team collaborated with several foundations and NGOs and provided them with resources to verify and tackle the spread of misinformation. We even trained office bearers of these foundations in ways of sharing correct information to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

      While we have regularly been interacting with doctors and shooting videos with them wherein we are breaking down facts and debunking myths, we also initiated a social media campaign called "Sansani nahi sach". Television actor Aasif Sheikh was the face of this campaign.

      __Rakesh Dubbudu:__ Local governments must curate and adopt local solutions (communication campaigns) through partnering with community mobilizers, religious leaders, doctors, ASHA workers, among others. Celebrity endorsements on TV also improve vaccine confidence.

      There have been multiple success stories where media such as art forms (theatre or skits) and other incentives have improved the vaccine uptake.

      __Uzair Rizvi:__ Celebrity endorsements will help in disseminating information. Door to door campaigning by health workers can also spread information about the efficacy and benefits of Covid vaccines.

    body: "\nMeedan’s Digital Health Lab is pleased to announce a new training collaboration
      with the [Facebook Journalism Project](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject)
      to support fact checkers in fighting health misinformation online. This is part
      of a growing [set of resources](https://meedan.com/blog/global-covid-19-vaccine-hub-shares-science-backed-info-with-journalists-and/)
      that the Digital Health Lab is offering to media partners, health institutions
      and platforms as they work to verify and debunk critical health information.
      \n\nMeedan’s Digital Health Lab will facilitate a series of virtual training
      sessions between its team of doctors, scientists and health experts and Facebook’s
      [third-party fact-checking partners](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/partner-map).
      In addition to using best practices from the field of public health communications,
      the training will apply research that shows that strong, reliable partnerships
      with experts plays a big role in effectively addressing misinformation. The
      Lab’s team of scientists will work together with fact-checkers to design the
      training sessions around the core information needs of fact-checkers. The two
      fields (public health and journalism) will collaborate together on building
      solutions for health misinformation issues.  \n\n“Our team of scientists are
      thrilled to offer close support to the Facebook Journalism Project through this
      collaboration,” notes Megan Marrelli, Health Desk Lead. “The series of workshops
      we’re offering will foster dynamic collaboration between scientists and fact-checkers
      around the world, who are fighting health misinformation every day. Cross-industry
      collaboration is key to targeting harmful online health claims. We need information
      leaders in science, journalism and technology to come together to forge innovative
      paths forward, and that is what we hope this workshop can offer.” \n\n“We’re
      excited to partner with Meedan to foster collaboration between our independent
      fact-checking partners and Meedan’s team of health experts, with a shared goal
      of addressing health misinformation more quickly and effectively,” said Keren
      Goldshlager, News Integrity Partnerships Lead at Facebook.\n\nHealth Desk’s
      content is written by a growing team of experts in infectious diseases, vaccination
      policy, nutrition, and the environment. They include researchers from the [Harvard
      T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) and scientists
      with experience working around the world and in multiple languages.\n\n“There
      has never been a more important time for digital, global audiences to have reliable,
      trusted, locally-relevant and accurate health information,” said Nat Gyenes,
      Director of Meedan’s Digital Health Lab. “Increasingly, research has identified
      the impact that online health misinformation has on offline health outcomes.
      The public health community at large has a responsibility to support the incredible
      work that fact-checking organizations are doing to address the very real and
      consequential health misinformation affecting their communities. Meedan’s Health
      Desk team is excited to be part of this effort, which we hope will make it easier
      for fact checkers to answers to their health science questions, with greater
      support for fact-checking topics relevant to the the complex and ever-changing
      public health information ecosystem.” \n\nIn addition to the training opportunities,
      Facebook’s fact-checking partners will also have access to Meedan’s Health Desk.
      This will provide them with timely answers to key public health questions to
      support their health-related fact-checking efforts. If fact-checkers can’t find
      answers to what they’re looking for on Health Desk, they can submit questions
      by email or an online form and Health Desk’s team of scientists will respond
      quickly.\n\nFor more information about this program as well as other Digital
      Health Lab projects, email press@meedan.com. \n"

    body: "Most of us go online every day to read the news, interact with others via
      social media, gather information, and make household purchases. Global technology
      giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and others influence
      what we see online, the sites we visit, and how we interact with content. They
      can also impact how we make decisions about our health. \n\nGlobal technology
      and social media companies represent a gap in what public health experts call
      the commercial determinants of health. Companies in agriculture, energy and
      other fields market their products, lobby governments, make displays of social
      responsibility, and maintain a massive global presence. Through these avenues,
      they have the power to impact health-related decision-making at the individual,
      household, community, national, and international levels. \n\nUnlike other organizations,
      tech companies employ complex algorithms, cross-platform advertising, and hosted
      content that shape what users’ [see online ](https://repository.kisti.re.kr/bitstream/10580/13511/1/Zimmer_Scheibe_Stock_Stock_v7n2_40-53.pdf)based
      on their behavior and engagement patterns. Of course, not all of the information
      online is factual;it may be true, partially true, or false. Tech tools create
      [echo chambers](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/9/e2023301118) that reinforce
      and bolster users’ existing beliefs and biases and foster continued online engagement.
      \nTech companies profit by [holding users' attention](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/social-media-companies-profiting-misinformation),
      using ads to sponsor [websites](https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-advertising-on-covid-19-misinformation/)
      that spread misinformation, which can involve, in some cases,  [hosting content](https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_6910f8ab94a241cfa088953dd5e60968.pdf)
      from “anti-vaxx” and other conspiracy theory groups. \n\nOur health is affected
      by where we live, the food we eat, how much money we have, access to health
      services, and who is part of our social networks. However, these social determinants
      of health fail to holistically include the online ‘infosphere’, as I shared
      in a [blog post](https://meedan.com/blog/information-as-a-social-determinant-of-health/)
      in April. \n\nResearch has shown that online content can influence [decision-making](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0747563217303357),
      [local cultures](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52249-0_33),
      [body image](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)30110-1/fulltext),
      lifestyle choices, and health habits, especially for individuals with low levels
      of health literacy. And when we consider how the quality, accuracy, accessibility,
      and availability of information can impact our health, we must also acknowledge
      that commercial influencers shape the information we see and how we receive
      it. Commercial entities wield a tremendous amount of power over how we make
      health-related decisions. \n\nCommercial determinants of health are commonly
      [defined as](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.12118) “factors
      that influence health which stem from the profit motive.” Historically, public
      health work and research in this space has [focused](http://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-017-0255-3)
      on how companies sell products (including highly-processed foods, beverages,
      alcohol, and tobacco) that contribute to early mortality and diseases including
      obesity, cancer, and type-2 diabetes. \n\nAdditional studies have explored [commercial
      interests](https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00607-x)
      that negatively impact health through contributions to environmental pollution,
      pesticide and chemical exposure, poor access to safe living conditions, and
      unequal access to medications and health services. \n\nWhile there are efforts
      to foster corporate accountability and engagement in health promotion activities,
      there is a longstanding tension between the public health community and private
      sector players. The commercial determinants of health present a considerable
      challenge that requires cross-sectoral collaboration and innovative partnerships.
      While companies often favor [personal responsibility](http://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-017-0255-3)
      over regulatory or policy interventions, [multisectoral engagement](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/371435/multisectoral-report-h1720-eng.pdf)
      across economics, finance, policy, research, healthcare, social sciences, public
      health, and others is vital. \n\nIn the tech sector, broad, coordinated policy
      actions have not been taken to improve the quality of health content, though
      some companies are actively working to improve health content on their individual
      platforms by implementing their own policies, strengthening content moderation
      and fact-checking practices, and redeveloping algorithms. For example, in an
      industry first, on July 1, 2021, [Pinterest banned ads](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-embraces-body-acceptance-with-new-ad-policy)
      containing weight loss-related products, images, or language in response to
      a rise in disordered eating habits and conditions over the past year.\n\nUnfortunately,
      there is not a singular response or “quick fix” solution to addressing the commercial
      determinants of health across sectors, and [additional research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757975920931249)
      is needed to further define and understand how these factors impact health.
      Furthermore, we must acknowledge tech companies as unique entities in commercial
      determinants of health models since search engines, social media companies,
      messaging platforms, and online advertising engines do and will continue to
      influence the health infosphere."

      the information bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and
      the journalism and fact-checking communities that need to get the information
      accurately and quickly.\n\nTo our community, we appreciate you, we are grateful
      for you, and our team of scientists is on-call for you as public health information
      response priorities shift and expand in 2021.   \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative."
    body: "To our incredible community of journalists, fact-checkers, podcasters,
      artists, and designers, and to the supporters that believed in the importance
      of collaborative responses to public health information inequities,\n\nThank
      you for making it possible to continue our public health response work. \n\nSince
      2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate the information
      bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and the journalism
      and fact-checking communities that need to get the information accurately and
      quickly. \n\nAs part of Meedan's Digital Health Lab, we are entering the second
      year of Health Desk project. Journalists and public health experts are continuing
      to work together in a time of crisis to get fast, reliable information to newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations around the world. With a rapid-response publishing
      process that borrows from two distinct industries—computer engineering and television
      news—our all-women team has written more than 200 explainers on COVID-19 topics
      for journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nIn local newsrooms from Delhi to Indianapolis,
      our work means that journalists do not have to scramble to find experts for
      comment every time COVID-19 news breaks. This alleviates an information bottleneck
      between critical emerging scientific research and public audiences that need
      to get the information accurately and quickly. \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative.
      For updates, check out [https://health-desk.org/vaccines/](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).
      \n\nWorking with you all over the last year has been an honor. The explainers,
      glossary terms and resources that our scientists have created to support communicators
      reaches audiences in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America. A sample content impact audit recently highlighted
      that 81% of the public health pieces that we have supported are on the front-page
      of Google search results for that topic in the region covered. That is such
      an essential metric as we think about the health information data voids that
      exist online, and how your work fills the information gaps that might otherwise
      largely contain problematic health misinformation.  \n\nWith a small team of
      scientists, researchers and communicators to influence diverse information spaces,
      these collaborations have shown the level of scale that can be made possible
      through syndication models for content dissemination, and strong collaborations
      across the public health and journalism fields. \n\nConversations with partner
      organizations have demonstrated how having access to experts can increase the
      subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and therefore the content available
      online to the fact-checkers’and journalists' audiences. How can we work together
      to continue to fill public health information gaps across a variety of topics,
      ranging from vaccinations to infectious disease, from nutrition to reproductive
      health care? \n\nAt a presentation our team participated in about health misinformation
      hosted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, health
      fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”, and
      this is in direct response to the public health efforts of innovative communicators
      around the world. This includes our amazing partners: VERA Files, India Today,
      Nigeria Health Watch, Speak Up Africa, Boom Live, Africa Check, Animal Politico,
      and many more. We're grateful for your dedication to untangling complex questions
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic, fact-checking in an era of evolving science
      and moments of uncertainty. Your response to the misinfodemic is vital.  \n\nWe
      have also started to serve local community media outlets in the United States,
      including public broadcasters such as the Atlanta NPR-affiliate, WABE, and Indianapolis’
      public radio station WFYI, as well as large media organizations like the New
      York Times and Reuters. Through a broader network of public broadcasters in
      the United States, called America Amplified, COVID-19 questions answered by
      Meedan scientists are brought to local audiences across the country. Our media
      partnerships also include Tayo Help Desk, a resource that offers American Filipinos
      localized insights into COVID-19 information. \n\nWe thank each and every one
      of the journalists, fact-checkers, and communicators that have come to us for
      support, and are looking forward to continuing collaborations in 2021. \n\nHere's

    description: Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines
    body: "Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines thanks to a global
      alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s public health
      expert team, supported by the Google News Initiative.\n\nIn 2020 Meedan’s Digital
      Health Lab developed a [COVID-19 rapid information response initiative](https://health-desk.org/)
      to support our fact-checking and community media partners around the world,
      as they worked tirelessly to respond to COVID-19 misinformation. We were able
      to launch the initiative with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
      the Omidyar Network, and the Google News Initiative. In  2021, Meedan will be
      expanding the supported range of health topics as part of [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/),
      \ beginning with the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nOver the last year, the public health
      expert team working on Health Desk created a system for providing rapid responses
      to questions shared by fact-checkers, journalists, and other communicators around
      the world sharing vital COVID-19 information with different audiences. In response
      to health questions from fact-checkers and journalists (which you can always
      submit [here](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/ask-a-question), or via email directly
      to health@meedan.com), our team:\n\n- Reviews and summarizes the latest science
      for the topic that you are reporting on\n- Provides background and context for
      that topic as it relates to health research more generally, and\n- Gives you
      a list of important additional resources or sources you can review for your
      reporting or fact-checking\n\nBuilding off of this work, in partnership with
      the Australian Science Media Centre and their network of additional Science
      Media Centres around the world, the COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub will bring together
      multiple sources of evidence-based information on vaccines with material available
      in at least seven languages. The alliance will involve collaboration with organisations
      and experts from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
      region.\n\n“The threat of health misinformation has become a vector for the
      spread of infectious diseases and in the context of COVID-19, a  significant
      barrier to vaccine adherence. We see a networked approach to addressing information
      equity challenges as a critical public health need. With the global science
      community collaborating on providing fact-checkers and media partners with reliable,
      and time-sensitive health information that communicators can effectively report
      and respond to the vaccine information needs of their audiences. We are honored
      to work with the Australian Science Media Centre and their partner Science Media
      Centres on this critical initiative,” said Nat Gyenes, Director of the Meedan
      Digital Health Lab.\n\nThe media hub will include expert commentary and explainers
      that will help journalists and fact-checkers report on the science behind the
      COVID-19 vaccines being developed. \n\n“The COVID-19 vaccine development and
      roll-out are unprecedented. Fighting misinformation about this topic will require
      both targeting harmful hoaxes directly and supporting the crucial work of science
      beat reporters and fact-checkers informing the public. It is with this in mind
      that we’re thrilled to support the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub
      to help journalists access expertise rapidly and reliably”, said Alexios Mantzarlis,
      News and Information Credibility Lead, Google News Lab\n\n“The enormous impact
      of this pandemic has meant that scientists and pharmaceutical companies have
      had to go into overdrive to produce vaccines in record time. With so many vaccines
      in various stages of development, it can be very confusing for journalists and
      the public and this is where we hope to help,” said Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO
      of the AusSMC. “It’s now more critical than ever that we all have access to
      clear information about these vaccines as they are being developed”.\n\nIf you’re
      a fact-checker, journalist, community organizer or communicator working to respond
      to vaccine misinformation or strengthen vaccine adherence, and you’re interested
      in collaborating or learning more, please reach out to health@meedan.com, and
      check out our existing health information resources: [https://health-desk.org/](https://health-desk.org/),
      and sign up to receive updates on the launch of the [Vaccine Media Hub](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).

    description: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance,
      the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool
      resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health
      emergencies in Africa.
    body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information
      since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been
      shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million
      times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African
      Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the
      United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.
      \n\nA large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and
      continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday.
      The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
      is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
      is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
      they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset
      of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies
      around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In
      health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to
      spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about
      their health and well-being, and a glut of information - an infodemic - with
      misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This
      crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop
      the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional
      Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the  Africa Infodemic Response Alliance
      \ will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines
      and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement
      efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.\n\nThe network is the
      first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional
      organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural
      science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect,
      disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.
      \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support
      journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based
      on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues. It also aims
      to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management
      strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists
      and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.\n\nThis
      initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that
      were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under
      the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe
      Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross
      and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the
      United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating
      and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check,
      PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
      public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
      for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
      ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
      can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab."

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America__, with localization of both text and accompanying
      visuals (thanks, to [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)
      and [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/)) __in 8 languages__
      prioritized by our partners \n- The __public health community__, including health
      literacy practitioners, __is eager and excited to get more involved__ in supporting
      local misinformation response efforts\n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-reuters](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4xgsZVcR02vLjnusBejbyo/189a7297d4d3b38964e5219f5af26ee4/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-reuters.jpg)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Reporting done by Reuters about herd immunity and COVID-19
      using Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough
      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

    body: "The pandemic has left us all trying to untangle new and complicated COVID-19
      information. It’s been an overwhelming and continuous part of the pandemic,
      and it’s not one that’s just in our heads. New research suggests that few websites
      are publishing COVID-19 content at a reading level that works for the general
      population. \n\nEveryone has the [right to information](https://hhi.harvard.edu/files/humanitarianinitiative/files/signalcode_final.pdf?m=1607469621)
      during a crisis. Unavailable, unclear, or inaccessible communications can increase
      anxiety, especially during times of uncertainty and ambiguity. Complex messages
      are also prone to misunderstandings. Misinterpretation or misapplication of
      complex topics like COVID-19 can result in the spread of misinformation and
      midinformation.\n\nOver the past year, researchers have studied the “readability”
      of COVID-19 information published online. What’s readability, you ask? Reading
      level tools that give “readability scores” estimate the number of years of education
      needed to understand a piece of content. In the U.S., many newspapers publish
      content to accommodate people who read between an eighth- and tenth-grade level.
      However, the average American reading level is around grade five or six. For
      [low-literacy](https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication/clear-simple)
      readers, experts recommend creating materials at a reading level between third
      and fifth grade. \n\nThe recent studies found that most COVID-19 information
      websites aren’t meeting us where we’re at:\n\n- [Worrall and colleagues](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-020-09710-5.pdf)
      assessed the readability of COVID-19-related content for a total of 240 English
      language webpage URLs from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United
      States. Using four tools, the team found that only 17.2% (n=165) of all readability
      scores analyzed were at a universally readable level. They also found that government
      and public health organization websites scored better than academic or scientific
      institutions, digital media, or others.\n\n- [Basch and colleagues](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/public-health-communication-in-time-of-crisis-readability-of-online-covid19-information/E1B32CF9E602F287902AD91F1D10DA7D)
      conducted a similar study of COVID-19 online search results from 100 English
      language websites. They also found that most websites were above a tenth-grade
      reading level target. In their sample, only four websites had content at less
      than a sixth-grade reading level.\n\n- [Mishra and Dexter](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2769382?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2020.18033)
      compared COVID-19 information readability from official public health agencies
      and governments of 15 countries. They found that all 18 websites scored above
      a sixth to eighth-grade reading level. They also found that 95% (n=141) scored
      above grade eight for all five readability metrics.\n\n- Additional COVID-19-related
      readability studies by [Szmuda and colleagues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350620302031?via%3Dihub),
      [Garcia and colleagues](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10900-021-00973-6),
      and [Ferguson and colleagues](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.13066)
      suggested that the reading ease of COVID-19-related health information online
      is a major problem. \n\nIn a recent reflection on our Health-Desk work, we conducted
      a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews (n=6) with partner journalists
      and fact-checkers from six different countries. The partners we interviewed
      endorsed the quality, readability, and applicability of our content in supporting
      their fact-checking efforts. \n\nTo further our evaluation, we conducted a readability
      audit. We chose 27 COVID-19-related Health Desk explainers written between June
      and December 2020. All of the audited entries were ones submitted by our media
      partners. The queries covered a variety of key topics, including nutrition,
      vaccines, testing, masks, treatment, and statistics.\n\nLike many similar studies
      from the past year, we used an [online readability tool](https://readable.com/)
      to score our content. By our measurements, like so many COVID-19 communication
      websites out there today, we also failed to meet the recommended targets for
      readability at the sixth or tenth-grade targets. Our sample reading score was
      around a grade 15 (95%CI: 14.61, 15.63), which is considered difficult to read
      and appropriate for college students.\n\nThere’s some nuance to this. While
      readability is important, using [reading ease alone](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/WrittenMaterialsToolkit/ToolkitPart07)
      to determine how well the public will understand health messaging is problematic.
      [Health literacy](https://www.cdc.gov/healthliteracy/learn/index.html) efforts
      focus on how well individuals can find, understand, and use information to make
      health-related decisions. Readability scores should be considered together with
      clear communications tools to promote accessibility, actionability, and health
      literacy.\n\nThere are many tools available through the [U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthliteracy/developmaterials/plainlanguage.html),
      [U.S. National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication/clear-simple),
      the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/about/communications), and
      others to improve health communications. These leading health organizations
      all suggest that plain language principles should be used in all general communications:
      \n\n- Engage the reader by organizing content to answer their questions. Include
      a main message (or messages) at the beginning of the piece.\n- Use short sentences.\n-
      Keep the readability grade level as low as possible to ensure that more people
      can understand the content.\n- Use an active voice so that readers understand
      what to do with the information provided.\n- Use everyday, plain, or common
      language.\n\nOur Health Desk editorial team and public health experts are continuing
      to evaluate where and how to improve communications to support health literacy
      and equity. We have used an adapted clear communications tool from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index.html)
      to assess our explainers further, and we will apply our learnings to improve
      our Health Desk content. We will integrate more action statements, begin using
      simpler text, and adjust formatting. In the coming weeks, we will also implement
      new editorial standards. Our new standards employ principles from journalism,
      crisis communications, education, and health literacy. These are actions that
      we encourage all health communicators to adopt, because readability is an important
      fixture of our health information ecosystems. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has
      highlighted the need for resource investment in preparedness planning. It has
      also highlighted the need for improved communications. We must ensure that the
      public has the information needed to make safe and informed health decisions
      to protect their health and the health of their families, friends, and communities.
      The findings from studies of government, academic, and public-health-focused
