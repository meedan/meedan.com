    body: "On the Meedan engineering team we are trying to clean up the way we write
      Git commits in order to help our engineers communicate more clearly with one
      another and to make our jobs that much easier in the future when we’re looking
      back at old code. One strategy we are attempting is to write longform Git commits.\n\n>
      Meedan is hiring for our engineering team! Join us and enjoy the benefits of
      verbose git commits. Positions are open for a [Backend Engineer (Remote)](https://meedan.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=30)
      and a [Machine Learning Engineer](https://meedan.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=33).\n\n###
      What is a longform Git commit?\nWhen most engineers are taught how to commit
      a change to Git, we learn to do something like:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-git\">\ngit
      commit -m \"This is my commit message\"\n</code></pre>\n\nThis certainly works,
      but writing a commit message this way is very limiting. The command line is
      not a great place to write long human-readable text, so this encourages short
      commit messages that are not descriptive. Plus, it's difficult to include special
      punctuation this way. For example, ```!``` and newlines need to be escaped inside
      the message string.\n\nA good rule of thumb: ```git commit -m``` should not
      be your default! You should be doing `git commit` or `git commit -a`. Even better
      is ```git commit -v -a```, which will pull up [your editor of choice](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git
      \"Associating text editors of your choice with git\") and let you easily write
      a commit. The -v means \"verbose\" and will add a diff of all your changes.
      Let's change some code and try:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-git\">\n$ git
      commit -av\n</code></pre>\n\nYou probably already know that `-a` means \"add\",
      which basically runs `git add .` before running the commit. But not a lot of
      people know about `-v`. This switch provides a diff inside the text file you
      are going to edit in whatever git's default text editor is set to. It will look
      something like this:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-git\">\n# Please enter the
      commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored,
      and an empty message aborts the commit.\n#\n# On branch working\n# Changes to
      be committed:\n#       modified:   foo.js\n#\n# ------------------------ >8
      ------------------------\n# Do not modify or remove the line above.\n# Everything
      below it will be ignored.\ndiff --git foo.js foo.js\nindex d575e27..6afb236
      100644\n--- foo.js\n+++ foo.js\n@@ -6,6 +6,6 @@ \n function multiply(a, b) {\n-
      \ return a / b;\n+  return a * b;\n }\n </code></pre>\n\n Note the diff on the
      end, telling us that we corrected the math in our multiply function.\n\nI find
      including the diff helpful for writing the commit because I can simply refer
      to the changes I've made right there. It also means that I can use autocomplete
      to complete variable names because any code I wrote is down there. The diff
      won't be included in the commit, just all the stuff above the comment lines.\n\nSo,
      what do we type here now that we are in this document? I like to think of commits
      as emails, with a subject, a body, and a footer.\n\nThe subject portion is the
      first line of the text, before a line break. This briefly describes the changes
      we made in this commit. In our case we might want it to be something like \"Fix
      our multiply function\". This should be short, and written in the imperative
      voice (\"command\" words like \"fix\" instead of \"fixed\" or \"fixes\"). Most
      guides out there say to keep it to 50 characters or less. Popular text editors
      will even include helpful syntax highlighting for your commit message. For example,
      if you have syntax on set in Vim, it will highlight the first line in red if
      it goes over 50 characters in length.\n\nThe body should explain what changed
      and why. The \"what\" describes the techniques and solutions you applied. You
      might even link to blog posts that helped you get a handle on the problem. I
      like to write the body of the message in markdown, since it's pretty readable
      on its own and can easily be cut and pasted into a pull request form on Github
      or Gitlab. The \"why\" doesn't mean from a project management standpoint --
      so no need to say \"I'm doing this because our client asked for it\". What I
      mean by \"why\" here is relevant contextual information. For example, why did
      you implement your change the way you did versus the other possible ways you
      could have done it?\n\nAnd the footer is any extra information, metadata-like
      stuff. This is usually where I put the issue number that the commit is related
      to.\n\nUltimately we might write something like the following:\n\n<pre><code
      class=\"language-git\">\nFix our multiply function\n​\nSwapped `/` for `*`.
      Apparently multiplication and division are two different\nthings! We want to
      do\n[multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication) because\notherwise
      everything breaks. I did some research and found out that `*`\nmeans \"multiply\"
      in most popular programming languages.\n​\nIn the future we could also consider
      dividing by the inverse of an operand,\nin case we move to a programming langauge
      that doesn't support multiplication.\n​\nFixes #1234.\n​\n# Please enter the
      commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored,
      and an empty message aborts the commit.\n#\n# On branch working\n# Changes to
      be committed:\n#       modified:   foo.js\n#\n# ------------------------ >8
      ------------------------\n# Do not modify or remove the line above.\n# Everything
      below it will be ignored.\ndiff --git foo.js foo.js\nindex d575e27..6afb236
      100644\n--- foo.js\n+++ foo.js\n@@ -6,6 +6,6 @@ \n function multiply(a, b) {\n-
      \ return a / b;\n+  return a * b;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\nFor a real example of
      this in action, you can look at [this commit on Check](https://github.com/meedan/check-web/commit/452acb9519b65fbe5e0bb48f4bec7ce120debdd2).\n\n###
      How does this actually help developers?\n\nOkay, so we have made a bunch of
      commits in the format I've described above. How does this make day-to-day development
      easier? It all comes down to organizing information about the software you're
      developing, and centralizing developer-facing data in Git instead of somewhere
      else.\n\nShort subject lines are beneficial in at least two places: git log
      output and the \"commits\" page on your Git host of choice.\n\nWhen it comes
      to logs, I like to use the `--oneline` command line switch to see an abbreviated
      version of recent changes. This gives us just the short subject lines. Check
      out these actual git log outputs for commits that do __not__ use the above formatting
      recommendations:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-git\">\n$ git log --oneline
      --no-decorate\n\n3340a1653 CHECK-1254 Updating check-ui version\na6e92ddc7 CHECK-1252:

      folder per workspace (#983)\n6e91692aa Ticket CHECK-1195: Gray-out the previous
      and next links if there are not search results to be displayed\n</code></pre>\n\nNow
      compare it to a version of the same log that I've edited to reflect the above
      formatting suggestions:\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-git\">\n$ git log --oneline
      --no-decorate\n\n3340a1653 Update check-ui version\na6e92ddc7 Remove \"none\"

      Update l10n\nc67e74427 Change logic for folder organization\nd84b757e2 Add default
      folder per workspace\n6e91692aa Update previous/next link behavior in search\n</code></pre>\n\nYou'll
      notice that I removed otherwise-critical context information from several commits.
      For example, \"propose folders as destination for rejecting suggested and make
      default folder on the top of list\" has become \"Change logic for folder organization\".
      That's based on the assumption that the details of what changed would move from
      the subject of the commit down to the body. The subject really just needs to
      let someone scanning commits understand that the code in this commit touches
      the folder organization systems, and then the reader can `git show [hash]` if
      they need to know more. I also removed Jira ticket numbers and Github pull request
      numbers. Those can also go in the body text.\n\nUltimately, good subject lines
      make the timeline of development legible.\n\nIn contrast to subject lines, body
      text is not about brevity. It's about including as much context as makes sense
      for a commit, ideally in plaintext language. I think of the body text of Git
      commits like a textual database of knowledge about the code.\n\nFor example,
      I can use the `--grep` switch for `git log` to search this database (along with
      `-i` to make the search case-insensitive). Let's say I am working on a bug related
      to a modal dialog, and I have the sneaking suspicion that I might have introduced
      it as a regression in the last six months. Here I am searching the code for
      all commits I have made that are related to the concept of a [modal](https://material.io/components/dialogs):\n\n<pre><code
      class=\"language-git\">\n$ git log --author=\"Darius\" --grep=\"modal\" -i\n\ncommit
      5166bb2388c6058351aaa4b05bc9729a015e9914\nAuthor: Darius Kazemi <darius@meedan.com>\nDate:
      \  Thu Mar 17 13:10:02 2022 -0700\n\n    Add option to disable title hyperlinks
      to MediaItem\n\n    Calling this `modalOnly` because moreso than disabling the
      title it means\n that clicking anywhere on the card pops up the modal and only
      the modal.\n\n    Fixes CHECK-1573\n\ncommit 8d0d9e50f4563b48447fc9ef23590eb150b1e538\nAuthor:
      Darius Kazemi <darius@meedan.com>\nDate:   Mon Nov 15 15:26:53 2021 -0800\n\n
      \   Add modal prompt when navigating away during edit\n\n    This commit attaches
      a `useEffect` to the task editor that loads/unloads\n a browser confirmation
      EventListener depending on if the annotation widget\n is in the editing state.\n\n
      \   Fixes CHECK-1093\n</code></pre>\n\nNot only does this pull up my previous
      modal work, but looking at these results I can quickly understand the context
      of what I was doing at the time and why I made some of the decisions that I
      did. When I do `git show [hash]` to view the code changes, I'll have a much
      better understanding of why the diff is the way it is!\n\nAnother advantage
      of verbose body text is that writing pull requests becomes extremely easy. Have
      you ever made a bunch of commits and then written a pull request the next day?
      Sometimes it's hard to remember the context of the work you were doing, and
      that makes it hard to write a good pull request. Using longform commits, I will
      often just copy and paste the body text of my commits into a pull request composition
      form and it's already ~80% written for me. Since I write my body text in Markdown
      it's even nicely pre-formatted!\n\nIf you use Github, a neat little trick is
      that if your branch contains a single commit, Github will automatically populate
      the subject line as the title of the pull request and the body text as the body
      of the pull request. Remember [the commit that I linked earlier](https://github.com/meedan/check-web/commit/452acb9519b65fbe5e0bb48f4bec7ce120debdd2)?
      The [associated pull request](https://github.com/meedan/check-web/pull/1078)
      was automatically created using this method. The only thing I added was the
      screenshot for extra context.\n\n### Conclusion\nGood commit messages turn our
      Git repositories into a database of knowledge about our code and why it's implemented
      the way it is. This is distinct from something like Jira, which is a database
      for product management decisions. We could put technical implementation details
      in Jira, but in my opinion Git is the place where it makes sense for all this
      stuff to live. Our product managers don't need to know why we implemented something
      the way we did. They need to know that we implemented it, and when it happened,
      and when it's going live. Jira and similar project management tools are great
      for tracking that information. But information like you see in the body text
      of commits that I recommend above is basically noise as far as anyone outside
      of engineering is concerned, so let's keep that stuff to a place where only
      engineers are going to see it!"

      [Taiwan FactCheck Center](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/) is a leading fact-checking organization in Taiwan. Founded by Taiwan Media Watch and the Association for Quality Journalism, the Center does fact-checking with the objective of improving the information ecology and news quality of Taiwan. Meedan's Check Global program is honored to have Taiwan FactCheck Center as a partner. We have worked with the organization on different projects over the past two years, which includes a media literacy program for senior citizens, college students and TFC's collaboration with the VeraFiles, an independent fact-checking group in the Philippines, in promoting [VeraFiles' fact-checking ChatBot](https://meedan.com/blog/meet-vera-the-truth-bot/) to the Filipino community in Taiwan.

      In this blogpost we bring insights from Summer Chen, Editor in Chief at Taiwan FactCheck Center on the team's various efforts to combat mis-disinformation in the country. Summer in a message to fellow fact-checkers and TFC's readers drives a point that the international fact-checking day is not just of fact-checkers, but is a day to celebrate facts and truth and honor everyone who is part of the battle against misinformation.

      __Summer Chen, Editor in Chief at Taiwan FactCheck Center:__

      Since its launch in 2018, Taiwan FactCheck Center (TFC) has been committed to producing high-quality fact-checks in the fight against misinformation, as well as to spreading media literacy.

      To do that, we share the concept of fact-checking, our methodology, and verification skills and tools with media practitioners who are behind one of the most critical news sources in society. Every year we conduct media literacy training for journalists and we also train students, teachers, and passionate people from different communities.

      __Defending democracy and extending media literacy to more vulnerable sections of society__

      It is noteworthy that we take multiple approaches to broaden our reach. We constantly have workshops in universities across Taiwan to sow seeds of fact-checking among the youth. We also aim at senior citizens who are relatively more vulnerable to online misinformation by [partnering with digital instructors who specialize in training elderl](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/7049)y population. With the feedback from these experienced instructors, we are able to make our teaching materials and methods more fun and digestible.

      At TFC we build a front line along with the civil society to combat mis- and disinformation. By empowering the public to fact-check information, we are able to defend the integrity of the democracy and protect it from harm caused by disinformation. Whenever we have a debate or discussion over public policy or agenda, we often see disinformation spread with the intent to mislead the discussion or distract people's attention. We can only have meaningful discussions and rational decisions when we have access to factual information. That is the core of democracy.

      __Scaling up fact-checking using technology, AI and collaboration__

      We have [teamed ](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/6574)up with Taiwan Institute for Information Industry (III) who supports us to develop an AI filter tool, [Rumor catcher](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/6076). This tool allows us to collect and identify viral claims circulating online in real-time, speeding up as well as scaling our debunking work.

      This year, we are working with [VeraFiles](https://verafiles.org/), a fact-checking organization in the Philippines to introduce VeraFiles' fact-checking ChatBot to the Filipino communities in Taiwan. At the moment we have had around 100 Filipinos in Taiwan who have joined VERA ChatBot on Viber. Through this collaboration, the Filipino communities in Taiwan who might be at a disadvantage in terms of access to reliable information can have better means to protect themselves from misinformation. We want to support the Filipino diaspora to receive reliable information on the latest in their homeland so they can make evidence-based decisions for the best of their country.

      We have recently published this article (<https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/7050>) on one of the campaign events this February.

      __Message to fellow fact-checkers and TFC's readers on International fact-checking day__

      On the international fact-checking day, my team from Taiwan FactCheck Center wants to share some words with our audience.

      Fact-checking in Taiwan is contributed by groups of passionate people who are enthusiastic about the facts and truth. They actively flag claims to fact-checkers and share factual information with their family and friends; they learn about fact-checking with all their hearts. This tremendous amount of power and energy is the most valuable foundation against disinformation. So we think that fact-checking day doesn't just belong to fact-checkers- it is also a day in honor of facts and a celebration for everyone.

      of women globally, but also the fact that we are far from living in an equal
      world where all genders are respected, and we each have a unique role to play
      in getting there. \n\nThis International Women’s Day, we reflect on just that:
      what our role in reaching true gender parity and equity is as an organization
      steeped in the world of fact-checking and fighting misinformation. \n\nThe IWD
      campaign theme for 2022 is [#BreakTheBias](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/theme
      \"#BreakTheBias campaign\") – which asks people globally to imagine and fight
      for a world that is free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination, and where
      differences are celebrated and valued. In accordance with this theme, and as
      part of our reflections on our own role in fighting a patriarchal and sexist
      society, we are bringing awareness in this post to gendered misinformation –
      a subset of health misinformation that is under-researched and under-prioritized
      – with a focus on gendered health misinformation.\n\nIn this article, we differentiate
      between gendered disinformation and gendered misinformation, analyze the ways
      in which it presents online with a special focus on gendered misinformation
      in healthcare, and explain why it is an issue of concern to everyone.\n\nGendered
      disinformation is a subset of online or gendered abuse that uses heavily stereotyped
      narratives, fake stories, threats, and sometimes even sexually charged, distorted
      images to defame women and push them out of the public sphere. Gendered disinformation
      typically involves tailored harassment aimed to delegitimize and harm the target.
      Gendered disinformation in how it’s been researched also typically centers on
      the harassment, defamation, and sexualization of women specifically (though,
      to be clear, gendered disinformation also severely impacts trans and nonbinary
      people). \n\nWe define gendered misinformation, on the other hand, as the unintentional
      spread of false or substandard information that either stems from gendered biases,
      or is specifically about gender. While gendered misinformation can impact anyone
      of any gender, we see it disproportionately impact women, trans, and nonbinary
      people. Important note: gendered misinformation can be about sex, and not gender
      (eg. menstruation), but still be a gendered claim in nature.\n\nResearch (albeit
      limited) is clear that women are routinely targeted by [gendered disinformation](https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/gender-based-disinformation-advancing-our-understanding-and-response/
      \"Understanding gender based disinformation\"), typically in the form of intentional
      and coordinated sexist information campaigns and harassment. The [Wilson Center’s
      report](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/malign-creativity-how-gender-sex-and-lies-are-weaponized-against-women-online
      \"Wilson Center’s report on gendered disinformation\") “Malign Creativity: How
      Gender, Sex, and Lies are Weaponized Against Women Online” identifies the three
      defining characteristics of online disinformation as 1) falsity, 2) malign intent,
      and 3) coordination. \n\nMultiple reports have illuminated the real-world impacts
      of gendered disinformation. One [analysis](https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/gendered-disinformation-is-a-national-security-problem/
      \"Gendered disinformation is a national security problem\") of the 2020 U.S
      primaries focused on specifically women in politics shows that women candidates
      were intentionally and falsely attacked more often than male candidates. The
      [Wilson Center report mentioned above](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/malign-creativity-how-gender-sex-and-lies-are-weaponized-against-women-online
      \"Wilson Center’s report on gendered misinformation\") found that 9 of 13 female
      politicians surveyed across three countries and six social media platforms had
      been targets of gendered disinformation narratives. Across the world, women
      from politicians to journalists to public health officials have been threatened,
      [harassed](https://www.medicalbag.com/home/features/female-doctors-are-especially-vulnerable-to-online-harassment/
      \"Women doctors especially vulnerable to online harassment\"), [sent to prison](https://www.mediasupport.org/blogpost/digital-misogyny-why-gendered-disinformation-undermines-democracy/
      \"Digital misogyny\"), and [killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/world/asia/afghanistan-women-journalists.html
      \"Women journalists in Afghanistan\") as a result of gendered disinformation.\n\nUnlike
      gendered disinformation, which is intentional and coordinated sexist information
      campaigns, gendered misinformation may stem from a combination of external factors
      and internal factors, such as the lack of access to information and existing
      stereotyped beliefs. And though it is a concept that is less widely researched
      and more insidious, we at Meedan witness its spread and impacts every day in
      our work, and believe that its impacts are pervasive and harmful – in many ways
      exactly because of its insidious nature.\n\nGendered misinformation spans topics
      including politics, economics, health, societal roles, and culture. This post
      narrows in on gendered health misinformation, given our ongoing digital health
      work including [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/ \"Health Desk\"), through
      which we have observed gendered health misinformation trends since the project’s
      launch; for example, false claims about [vaccines and menstrual cycles](https://health-desk.org/articles/what-do-we-know-so-far-about-covid-19-vaccines-and-their-impact-on-menstruation
      \"vaccines and menstrual cycles fact-checks on Health Desk\") and false claims
      that [pregnant people shouldn’t get the vaccine](https://health-desk.org/articles/what-do-we-know-so-far-about-the-covid-19-vaccines-during-or-before-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding
      \"fact-check on pregnancy and COVID-19 vaccine on Health Desk\") to keep their
      baby safe. \n\nBoth of these are examples of gendered health misinformation,
      which, again is the unintentional spread of false or substandard information
      that either stems from gendered biases, or is specifically gendered. The first
      claim is specifically about people who can menstruate and is a gendered claim.
      The second claim is both about people who can get pregnant and is rooted in
      stereotypes about pregnant people needing to sacrifice (unnecessarily) for their
      baby. \n\nThe number of people online increases by the day, and more people
      have [access to the internet](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/
      \"Who has internet access worldwide\") than they do [essential healthcare services](https://www.who.int/news/item/13-12-2017-world-bank-and-who-half-the-world-lacks-access-to-essential-health-services-100-million-still-pushed-into-extreme-poverty-because-of-health-expenses
      \"Poverty worldwide and access to healthcare\"). This ubiquity of the internet
      combined with rampant sexism and stigma surrounding the healthcare of women,
      trans, and nonbinary people who already have [lower](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221583

      \"Recognizing, Addressing Unintended Gender Bias in Patient Care\") to quality
      healthcare than cis men results in a misleading and often harmful ecosystem
      of gendered health information online. \n\nEvery day, people around the world
      – especially women, trans, and nonbinary people – are bombarded with stereotypes
      and misleading facts about their bodies and their health. One [report](https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/plan-international-australia-launch-a-bold-new-campaign-to-stop-women-feeling-unsafe-after-dark/
      \"Plan International Australia report on online health misinformation\"), published
      by Plan International Australia, found that 1 in 5 girls interviewed felt unsafe
      as a result of online health information, and that, due to misinformation, 1
      in 4 questioned whether to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. The study
      reported that many participants “said they had concerns about fake events advertised
      on social media placing them at physical risk, or unreliable medical advice
      that could harm their health or impact their confidence in legitimate medical
      advice.”\n\nIn a different [study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445091
      \"Barriers to accurate online health misinformation for transgender and nonbinary
      patients\") on transgender health misinformation, transgender participants reported
      getting inaccurate and misleading information online about topics such as hormones,
      binding (the action of making one’s chest look flatter using clothing, binders,
      etc.), mental health, surgery, and coexisting conditions. One participant described
      the following about their experience seeking out health information online:
      “I was told – rather incorrectly – that my gender struggle (rather, my difficulty
      to understand what was feelings of dysphoria) was a dissociative symptom and
      meant I was bipolar and a danger to myself, but not nonbinary.” This misinformation
      led this person to delay seeking care and exacerbated existing mental health
      challenges – serving as just one example of how gendered health misinformation
      can actively cause harm.\n\nThis pervasiveness of gendered health misinformation
      is also what we’ve witnessed at Meedan in our digital health work, and has only
      amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. This amplification is due to three main
      factors: 1) [an increase in online activity overall](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7280123/
      \"Impact of digital surge during Covid-19 pandemic\"); 2) an increase in health
      concerns both related to COVID-19 and unrelated, as COVID-19 has dominated healthcare
      for two years and [worsened](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-nhs-backlog.html
      \"Backlog of healthcare issues due to Covid-19 pandemic\") [healthcare](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22555949/us-health-care-system-ranking-covid-19-pandemic
      \"US healthcare worse because of pandemic\") and [health outcomes](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00079-6/fulltext
      \"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal outcomes\") as
      a result; and 3) a [decrease in opportunities](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/9/feature-covid-19-economic-impacts-on-women
      \"Economic impacts of Covid-19 on women worldwide\") and [quality of life](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/impact-covid-19-pandemic-transgender-and-non-binary-community
      \"Impact of Covid-19 on transgender and nonbinary community\") for women, trans,
      and nonbinary folks since the onset of the pandemic. \n\nCommon gendered health
      misinformation topics include vaccines, hormones, hormone replacement therapy
      (HRT), menstruation, fertility and pregnancy, birth effects, abortion, sexually
      transmitted infections, diet, gender-affirming care, and intimate partner violence
      – among many others. This type of misinformation can be especially misleading
      and harmful because these topics are stigmatized – meaning that people may be
      more likely to look for answers online than elsewhere.\n\nOne stark example
      of gendered health misinformation is the wide range of rumors about the COVID-19
      vaccines and their supposed effect on fertility, menstruation, and pregnancy.
      We have received requests on Health Desk to address misinformation claims including
      “COVID-19 vaccines cause the placenta to not develop and lower fertility,” “COVID-19
      vaccines causing birth defects,” and “COVID-19 vaccines alter menstrual cycles
      for life.” These claims are [widespread](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789477
      \"Widespread Misinformation About Infertility Continues to Create COVID-19 Vaccine
      Hesitancy\") and erode trust in vaccines on aggregate, not just for people who
      can menstruate or bear children, showing how gendered health misinformation
      isn’t just a problem for the group being targeted, it’s a problem for everyone
      in that it reinforces gender stereotypes and promotes invalid science.\n\nAs
      evidence of this, one U.S-based [survey by KFF](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-media-and-misinformation/
      \"KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor\") found that out of about 1,500 nationally representative
      study participants, one third reported that they heard that COVID-19 vaccines
      caused infertility and either believed the myth was true or weren’t sure. Infamous
      vaccine scientist turned vaccine skeptic Robert Malone has also [erroneously
      claimed](https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/baseless-claims-about-mrna-vaccines-and-miscarriages/
      \"mRNA vaccine misinformation\") that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause significant
      disruptions in periods and miscarriages, citing that as one of the reasons that
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous.\n\nFor context, [data shows](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/covid-19-vaccines-linked-small-increase-menstrual-cycle-length#:~:text=The%20team%20found%20that%20women,with%20a%200.91%2Dday%20increase.
      \"Small increase in menstrual cycle length from Covid-19 vaccine dose scientific
      research\") that COVID-19 vaccines may cause a small increase in period cycle
      length by about less than a day after each dose, with any effects not lasting
      past that single cycle. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines
      cause miscarriage, but that claim is being used as a significant selling point
      for why the vaccines are dangerous. This example is just one of many in which
      gendered health misinformation not only targets women and people who menstruate,
      but is used to push broader health misinformation narratives.  \n\nExamples
      of gendered health misinformation claims unrelated to COVID-19 include “partners
      will be able to tell if you’ve had an abortion,” “feeding your baby formula
      as opposed to breastfeeding is wrong and harmful,” “transgender children are
      undergoing irreversible medical changes by transitionin,” “polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) is caused by the person who has it,” “using tampons causes cancer,”
      “if you got the HPV vaccine, you can skip your pap smear,” and “intimate partner
      violence doesn’t cause serious health problems.” \n\nGendered misinformation,
      and particularly gendered health misinformation, is an emerging concept that
      requires more research and refinement centered on those most impacted. We’re
      looking forward to diving into these claims further in future research, and
      shedding light on the ways that gendered health misinformation both harms and
      serves to uphold patriarchal values. Doing so is one small part of our own commitment
      to break the bias not only on International Women’s Day, but every day."

    body: "Preventing, moderating and debunking health misinformation can improve
      the public’s health and well-being. But not all anti-misinformation techniques
      are felt equally.\n\nAt Meedan we work with platforms and fact-checkers on some
      of the most critical health misinformation problems on the internet. \n\nTwo
      years into COVID-19, we find ourselves asking some of the following questions:
      What communities are most considered when health misinformation policies are
      developed? What topic areas are best moderated online and who do they apply
      to? What languages are used in automated misinformation searching? Importantly,
      the media has [started](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/democrats-experts-warn-spanish-language-disinformation-intensifying-rcna15172
      \"Spanish language used in automated misinformation searching\") [asking](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/11/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-digital-misinformation
      \"John Oliver on misinformation\") [those](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-latinx-community-and-covid-disinformation-campaigns
      \"Latinx community and COVID disinformation campaigns\") [questions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/28/misinformation-spanish-facebook-social-media/
      \"Spanish misinformation on Facebook\") [too](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/02/14/opinion/taking-scourge-online-spanish-language-misinformation/
      \"Spanish language misinformation feature in Boston Globe\"). \n\nProbing these
      questions reveals that, indeed, the benefits of moderation reflect existing
      health disparities and inequities, because people are not equally vulnerable
      to misinformation and response efforts are not being equally implemented. \n\nFor
      example, [research shows](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-02/misinformation_report_final1_0.pdf
      \"Alan Turing Institute report on misinformation\") that individuals with higher
      digital literacy, health literacy, numerical literacy, and cognitive skills
      are better at assessing health content and evading health misinformation. In
      addition, some communities spend more time online due to social factors. For
      instance, Latinos in the U.S. spend [twice as much time on YouTube](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/60668f2a28dee76b4ffebc73/1617334072783/Equis+Post-Mortem+Part+One+%28Public+Deck%29+%281%29.pdf
      \"Latino viewership of YouTube\") as non-Latino adults, making them more susceptible
      to online misinformation on the platform and making moderating efforts that
      don’t consider these discrepancies less effective. \n\nAnother example comes
      from [a study that showed](https://plan-international.org/publications/freetobeonline
      \"Lower income countries more susceptible to misinformation\") that participants
      from low and middle-income countries were more likely to be affected by unreliable
      or false information online than those from high-income countries, and twice
      as likely to have questioned whether to get the vaccine than those in high income
      countries.\n\nAnd just as the benefits of moderating health misinformation are
      disproportionate, so are consequences of not equitably moderating health misinformation
      online. Certain content moderation approaches can, in fact, exacerbate inequities
      or create new ones. \n\nFor instance, Meta appropriately and quickly took down
      a false video claim in English that COVID-19 vaccines have microchips and are
      connected to Bill Gates, but the same claim in a Spanish-language video [could
      still be viewed](https://www.axios.com/social-media-misinformation-latinos-2c3574d4-d437-402c-8606-94c2f6332abf.html
      \"Spanish misinformation video claims not moderated as much as English ones\")
      in the weeks following. In examples such as these, not only are Spanish-language
      speakers not benefiting from such moderation efforts, but actions like this
      one (which are well-intentioned to address misinformation) may actively make
      misinformation inequities larger. \n\nAnother challenge that can exacerbate
      existing inequities is the fact that people are not equally vulnerable to health
      problems. As a result, not considering those differences and targeting response
      efforts accordingly can create wider health gaps. \n\nFor instance, it is well-established
      that immigrant communities, non-white people, lower-income people, and people
      without stable housing – among other marginalized communities – have a higher
      risk of a range of negative health outcomes. Being at higher risk of certain
      health outcomes makes one more likely to seek out health information online,
      especially if one doesn’t have consistent access to formal healthcare. It also
      makes one more vulnerable to the harms of health misinformation.\n\nIn order
      to 1) both acknowledge and work to mitigate such inequities and 2) actively
      promote greater health equity, it’s important that social media platforms apply
      a public health approach to address health misinformation online, one that prioritizes
      impacts and wellbeing for the population of users as a whole and considers social
      disparities. \n\nMedical misinformation is a public health problem: it [can
      have](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34076397/ \"Vitiligo Health Education
      and misinformation\") [direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572169/
      \"US Surgeon General on confronting health misinformation\") [consequences](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/186-19/de-blasio-administration-s-health-department-declares-public-health-emergency-due-measles-crisis#/0
      \"NYC Health Department declares measles outbreak a public health emergency
      in 2019\") on human health and wellbeing and is a societal challenge; And a
      public health challenge requires a public health approach. \n\nThe simplest
      way of explaining the field of public health is that it deals with health from
      the perspective of populations as opposed to individuals. This is exactly how
      social media platforms should be thinking about how to address health misinformation:
      health misinformation moderation is not just about the harm that might come
      to one individual from a certain false claim, but analyzing and triaging harms
      of claims at scale, including based on who is most likely to be negatively impacted.
      \n\nAssessing the potential harm of claims is central to content moderation
      work. However, it’s not often done in a standardized way, and this type of public
      health approach is [typically not](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-examining-how-various-social-media-platforms-have-responded-to-covid-19-misinformation/
      \"Social media platform response to COVID-19 misinformation\") [built in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532328/
      \"social media health misinformation report\"). If platforms implemented a process
      for assessing or determining the potential harm of a claim through a public
      health framing – population-level thinking would be inherent and central to
      moderation, and lead to more equitable moderation and, resultantly, more equitable
      health outcomes. \n\nIn other words, when determining whether a claim is (for
      instance) low risk versus moderate risk, there’s population-level data and a
      health equity lens that feed into the decision making process. For instance,
      when considering a claim that handwashing isn’t important for preventing the
      flu, considerations should be made about who is most likely to suffer from this
      claim (in this case, older people, children, people who are in crowded spaces,
      people without access to high quality) and how those risks can be severe and
      disproportionate even if the claim doesn’t immediately read as severe from a
      non-public health perspective.\n\nPlatforms are going to continue to put more
      resources into moderating health misinformation online as the pandemic continues,
      as health topics continue to be polarized, and as more data emerges on the tangible
      harms of health misinformation. \n\nWith these ongoing changes comes an opportunity
      for platforms to move away from the more reactive policies that began [emerging
      in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/health/pinterest-vaccination-searches.html
      \"Pinterest vaccination searches\") in response to [growing concerns](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019
      \"Ten threats to global health in 2019\") of the harms of anti-vaccine misinformation
      online. Having had years of experience now in health moderation, especially
      around COVID-19, platforms can and should use this moment to collectively take
      a proactive approach by using and centering public health. Doing so would not
      only mitigate new information disparities, but importantly, will prevent existing
      ones from getting worse."

      the information bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and
      the journalism and fact-checking communities that need to get the information
      accurately and quickly.\n\nTo our community, we appreciate you, we are grateful
      for you, and our team of scientists is on-call for you as public health information
      response priorities shift and expand in 2021.   \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative."
    body: "To our incredible community of journalists, fact-checkers, podcasters,
      artists, and designers, and to the supporters that believed in the importance
      of collaborative responses to public health information inequities,\n\nThank
      you for making it possible to continue our public health response work. \n\nSince
      2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate the information
      bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and the journalism
      and fact-checking communities that need to get the information accurately and
      quickly. \n\nAs part of Meedan's Digital Health Lab, we are entering the second
      year of Health Desk project. Journalists and public health experts are continuing
      to work together in a time of crisis to get fast, reliable information to newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations around the world. With a rapid-response publishing
      process that borrows from two distinct industries—computer engineering and television
      news—our all-women team has written more than 200 explainers on COVID-19 topics
      for journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nIn local newsrooms from Delhi to Indianapolis,
      our work means that journalists do not have to scramble to find experts for
      comment every time COVID-19 news breaks. This alleviates an information bottleneck
      between critical emerging scientific research and public audiences that need
      to get the information accurately and quickly. \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative.
      For updates, check out [https://health-desk.org/vaccines/](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).
      \n\nWorking with you all over the last year has been an honor. The explainers,
      glossary terms and resources that our scientists have created to support communicators
      reaches audiences in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America. A sample content impact audit recently highlighted
      that 81% of the public health pieces that we have supported are on the front-page
      of Google search results for that topic in the region covered. That is such
      an essential metric as we think about the health information data voids that
      exist online, and how your work fills the information gaps that might otherwise
      largely contain problematic health misinformation.  \n\nWith a small team of
      scientists, researchers and communicators to influence diverse information spaces,
      these collaborations have shown the level of scale that can be made possible
      through syndication models for content dissemination, and strong collaborations
      across the public health and journalism fields. \n\nConversations with partner
      organizations have demonstrated how having access to experts can increase the
      subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and therefore the content available
      online to the fact-checkers’and journalists' audiences. How can we work together
      to continue to fill public health information gaps across a variety of topics,
      ranging from vaccinations to infectious disease, from nutrition to reproductive
      health care? \n\nAt a presentation our team participated in about health misinformation
      hosted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, health
      fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”, and
      this is in direct response to the public health efforts of innovative communicators
      around the world. This includes our amazing partners: VERA Files, India Today,
      Nigeria Health Watch, Speak Up Africa, Boom Live, Africa Check, Animal Politico,
      and many more. We're grateful for your dedication to untangling complex questions
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic, fact-checking in an era of evolving science
      and moments of uncertainty. Your response to the misinfodemic is vital.  \n\nWe
      have also started to serve local community media outlets in the United States,
      including public broadcasters such as the Atlanta NPR-affiliate, WABE, and Indianapolis’
      public radio station WFYI, as well as large media organizations like the New
      York Times and Reuters. Through a broader network of public broadcasters in
      the United States, called America Amplified, COVID-19 questions answered by
      Meedan scientists are brought to local audiences across the country. Our media
      partnerships also include Tayo Help Desk, a resource that offers American Filipinos
      localized insights into COVID-19 information. \n\nWe thank each and every one
      of the journalists, fact-checkers, and communicators that have come to us for
      support, and are looking forward to continuing collaborations in 2021. \n\nHere's

    description: Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines
    body: "Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines thanks to a global
      alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s public health
      expert team, supported by the Google News Initiative.\n\nIn 2020 Meedan’s Digital
      Health Lab developed a [COVID-19 rapid information response initiative](https://health-desk.org/)
      to support our fact-checking and community media partners around the world,
      as they worked tirelessly to respond to COVID-19 misinformation. We were able
      to launch the initiative with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
      the Omidyar Network, and the Google News Initiative. In  2021, Meedan will be
      expanding the supported range of health topics as part of [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/),
      \ beginning with the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nOver the last year, the public health
      expert team working on Health Desk created a system for providing rapid responses
      to questions shared by fact-checkers, journalists, and other communicators around
      the world sharing vital COVID-19 information with different audiences. In response
      to health questions from fact-checkers and journalists (which you can always
      submit [here](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/ask-a-question), or via email directly
      to health@meedan.com), our team:\n\n- Reviews and summarizes the latest science
      for the topic that you are reporting on\n- Provides background and context for
      that topic as it relates to health research more generally, and\n- Gives you
      a list of important additional resources or sources you can review for your
      reporting or fact-checking\n\nBuilding off of this work, in partnership with
      the Australian Science Media Centre and their network of additional Science
      Media Centres around the world, the COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub will bring together
      multiple sources of evidence-based information on vaccines with material available
      in at least seven languages. The alliance will involve collaboration with organisations
      and experts from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
      region.\n\n“The threat of health misinformation has become a vector for the
      spread of infectious diseases and in the context of COVID-19, a  significant
      barrier to vaccine adherence. We see a networked approach to addressing information
      equity challenges as a critical public health need. With the global science
      community collaborating on providing fact-checkers and media partners with reliable,
      and time-sensitive health information that communicators can effectively report
      and respond to the vaccine information needs of their audiences. We are honored
      to work with the Australian Science Media Centre and their partner Science Media
      Centres on this critical initiative,” said Nat Gyenes, Director of the Meedan
      Digital Health Lab.\n\nThe media hub will include expert commentary and explainers
      that will help journalists and fact-checkers report on the science behind the
      COVID-19 vaccines being developed. \n\n“The COVID-19 vaccine development and
      roll-out are unprecedented. Fighting misinformation about this topic will require
      both targeting harmful hoaxes directly and supporting the crucial work of science
      beat reporters and fact-checkers informing the public. It is with this in mind
      that we’re thrilled to support the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub
      to help journalists access expertise rapidly and reliably”, said Alexios Mantzarlis,
      News and Information Credibility Lead, Google News Lab\n\n“The enormous impact
      of this pandemic has meant that scientists and pharmaceutical companies have
      had to go into overdrive to produce vaccines in record time. With so many vaccines
      in various stages of development, it can be very confusing for journalists and
      the public and this is where we hope to help,” said Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO
      of the AusSMC. “It’s now more critical than ever that we all have access to
      clear information about these vaccines as they are being developed”.\n\nIf you’re
      a fact-checker, journalist, community organizer or communicator working to respond
      to vaccine misinformation or strengthen vaccine adherence, and you’re interested
      in collaborating or learning more, please reach out to health@meedan.com, and
      check out our existing health information resources: [https://health-desk.org/](https://health-desk.org/),
      and sign up to receive updates on the launch of the [Vaccine Media Hub](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).

    description: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance,
      the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool
      resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health
      emergencies in Africa.
    body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information
      since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been
      shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million
      times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African
      Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the
      United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.
      \n\nA large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and
      continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday.
      The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
      is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
      is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
      they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset
      of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies
      around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In
      health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to
      spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about
      their health and well-being, and a glut of information - an infodemic - with
      misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This
      crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop
      the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional
      Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the  Africa Infodemic Response Alliance
      \ will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines
      and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement
      efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.\n\nThe network is the
      first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional
      organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural
      science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect,
      disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.
      \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support
      journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based
      on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues. It also aims
      to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management
      strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists
      and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.\n\nThis
      initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that
      were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under
      the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe
      Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross
      and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the
      United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating
      and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check,
      PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
      public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
      for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
      ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
      can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab."

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully

      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

      Peace Prize comes at a crucial time as the Philippines gears up for the 2022
      national and local elections. Maria and Rappler have consistently exposed the
      abuse of power by president Rodrigo Duterte. The award is a recognition and
      affirmation of Maria and Rappler’s work and is an inspiration for all of us.
      \n\nMaria Ressa’s Nobel prize is also an accomplishment for women leading the
      fights for equality, social justice and freedom of speech across different areas
      and regions. As Meedan celebrates Maria Ressa’s Nobel award, women team members
      at Meedan, share reflections and perspectives on what this prize means to us.
      \n\n#### Dima Saber, Check Global Program Director\n\nThere are a few women
      who I turn to - in my own little mind - for inspiration and a confidence boost
      when things get bad in the many countries where we work as part of the Check
      Global project; Maria Ressa is at the top of that list. You know how you tend
      to over-idealise people whose work you respect so deeply, that it seems almost
      impossible for you to imagine a situation where you are actually face-to-face
      (well, at least virtually) with them, asking them questions, and enjoying every
      bit of their responses? Well, this is exactly how it felt when I was given the
      opportunity to [interview](https://meedan.com/blog/watch-reporting-barriers-during-covid-19-with-maria-ressa/)
      Maria Ressa for a Check Global network event back in May 2020, for a whole 52
      minutes and 22 seconds! I found myself in front of a kind, inspiring, humble,
      generous, and extremely sharp woman who is today leading the way to #HoldTheLine
      against oppression, despotism, propaganda and disinformation in the Philippines,
      and beyond it, across our emerging economies. The news of Maria Ressa winning
      the Nobel Peace Prize felt personal; as if someone very close to me has accomplished
      something great. It also made me realise that the struggles of all the journalists,
      activists, archivists and human rights defenders - the imprisoned, the disappeared
      and those still fighting for the same ideas and ideals as Ressa - are seen,
      legitimised and recognised, and this realisation is probably one of the best
      and most comforting things that's happened in 2021! \n\n#### Isabella Barroso,
      Program Manager - Latin America\n\nAbout 10 years ago when I left my career
      in journalism to work in technology, a lot of the reasoning at the time was
      based in fear. The type of investigative practice I admired and dreamed of working
      with was dangerous, and in some cases even deadly in Latin America. Fear stopped
      not only me but also a dozen of other colleagues from pursuing our objectives.
      At the time I had a teacher that used to say that good journalism cannot be
      based only on awards, she was, in her own way, saying that  are more journalists
      creating astounding and essential political work everyday, than awards to give
      them. In that sense, the award to Maria Ressa is also a way to recognize the
      work of many others fighting to uphold truth in a polarized world. This award
      will be a beacon of hope, and of inspiration to women journalists everywhere.
      It whispers: if you stay true, even though it won’t be safe for a while yet,
      your work can be a light for others. I forwarded the news of this award to a
      few of my old classmates, and we all shared a moment of pure happiness,  not
      only for her, but also for the future of women journalists and activists everywhere;
      may they follow Maria Ressa’s light, and never give up. \n\n#### Jenna Sherman,
      Program Manager, Digital Health Lab\n\nMaria Ressa’s Nobel Prize signifies to
      me the criticality of fighting for truth and just how high the stakes are of
      doing so. We strive to integrate Maria’s fervent commitment to objectivity and
      human rights into our every day work at Meedan, using that spirit to guide work
      that is often difficult and during circumstances that are often dark. As a public
      health practitioner working with journalists and fact-checkers to provide high
      quality health information to the public — particularly those who need it most
      — it can sometimes feel daunting and exhausting to keep up the work amidst significant
      misinformation, disinformation, and harassment. I’m so deeply grateful to have
      joined a team where from the very top, our managers are unwavering in their
      beliefs in information quality and equity being cornerstones of a better, more
      peaceful world, and am able to tap into that belief any time I start to feel
      weary.\n\n#### Nat Gyenes, Program Director, Digital Health Lab\n\nMaria Ressa
      is a role model for what it means to be courageous, to be determined, to dedicate
      the time needed to create a meaningful change in a challenging, broken system.
      So much of the work that our team has developed is inspired by Maria’s dedication,
      commitment to truth and the fight towards a better future: where power comes
      with accountability, especially in our information ecosystem. Our team of public
      health researchers has been working tirelessly over the last year and a half
      to support challenges in information equity related to both the COVID-19 pandemic,
      and all of the public health issue areas disproportionately affected or left
      under-resourced as a result of the pandemic. Working with journalists to ensure
      that the latest evidence is reflected in accurate reporting is an ongoing challenge
      as the evidence itself continues to evolve, but it is an essential component
      of sustaining trust in reliable and relevant health information. Of course,
      this is just one part of the broader challenge, where political and other power
      incentives and disinformation further exacerbate the challenges of information
      inequity. Maria serves as a leader and inspiration for Meedan’s theory of change,
      and for the values that inform our work and our mission, where we prioritize
      our responsibility to supporting truth. This award is so, so well deserved,
      and is an important milestone in the global recognition that an obstruction
      of truth is an obstruction of peace. \n\n#### Shalini Joshi, Program Director
      - Asia Pacific\n\nAs a woman journalist in India, I've always looked up to Maria
      Ressa as a torchbearer for freedom of expression and rights of other women journalists
      in the region. While women journalists are attacked, harassed, abused and maligned
      across Asia Pacific and in other regions, Maria shows us how to take on injustice
      and call out oppressors with courage and defiance. Maria Ressa being awarded
      the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize gives us hope that the fight for truth, facts and
      democracy is being recognised, upheld and validated.  \n\nAs a Check Global
      team member, I've had the honour and privilege of interacting with Maria on
      a few occasions; her energy, humility and wittiness in all conversations make
      the darkest of days seem brighter. These are grim times for journalists across
      Asia, however, meetings with Maria fill me with hope and optimism. I consider
      her to be a mentor, leading the way with her charismatic presence, dynamism
      and her brilliant tools of investigative journalism. I am incredibly proud of
      our partnership with Rappler and Maria Ressa. There can be no one more deserving
      of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n#### Sneha Alexander, Program Associate -
      Asia Pacific\n\nAs a Meedani, I have heard a lot about Maria Ressa, but have
      met her only once, in a virtual meeting. That left a lasting impression. The
      passion with which she spoke about the upcoming project that Rappler will lead
      in the Philippines was absolutely inspiring. It puts into perspective the importance
      of the work we are doing as part of the Check Global program along with a global
      network of journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nWhile speaking truth to power
      can be a solitary journey, Ressa highlights the importance of supporting and
      collaborating with each other across our respective networks   to deliver the
      hard hitting truth. If one falls, there should always be others to carry forward
      the task of speaking to power. It was the work of brave and committed journalists
      in India that drove me towards journalism in the early phase of my career. Listening
      to her, I was convinced that every young journalist should know about Maria
      Ressa and her work, and have the  chance to interact with her.  \n"
