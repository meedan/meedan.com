    body: "Meedan is excited to have Martin Peck on board as our Systems Engineer!
      As Meedan's software development and IT operations grow, Martin will ensure
      that all systems are truly go. Learn more about him in the short Q&A below.\n\n###
      1. What has been your experience before you joined Meedan? \n\nI have worked
      in a number of industries, including telecommunications, healthcare, even mobile
      gaming! Being a part of businesses large and small has taught me that I especially
      enjoy the challenges associated with younger companies developing new technologies.\n\nWhile
      I started off in software development, over the years I have applied these skills
      toward test automation and high performance computing, systems and application
      security, and technical operations.\n\nI find that DevOps utilizes a number
      of these interdisciplinary talents, and these experiences in turn make me a
      more effective operations engineer.\n\n### 2. Tell us about an exciting and
      insightful experience that has shaped your perspective and work.\n\nA few years
      ago I travelled to Sierra Leone to study their [aid benefit programs and technical
      solutions for the Ebola crisis.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/software-developers-helped-end-ebola-epidemic-sierra-leone
      \"Software developers helped end ebola epidemic\") It was a real eye opener
      for me to see how lack of infrastructure and technical literacy complicated
      efforts to build functional and accessible technology.\n\n### 3. What is the
      DevOps ecosystem like in the southwest? What are the strengths and what gaps
      do you see?\n\nI live in the northwest corner of Phoenix, Arizona. My parents
      grew up here, and when they were young this was all farmland.\n\nOver the past
      decade technology employment has really grown, and there is a healthy tech scene
      in the city. The diversity of talent here is a strength, but the rapid growth
      has also left businesses struggling to find people with the right skills.\n\nWith
      Intel and TSMC building new chip fabs here, I expect this talent crunch to continue.
      The governor of Arizona recently announced a collaboration among government,
      industry, and academia to bolster Arizona’s workforce called [Drive48](https://www.signalsaz.com/articles/arizona-launches-state-of-the-art-advanced-manufacturing-training-center/
      \"Arizona launches Drive48 program\") which will help educate and train people
      for these careers.\n\n### 4. What brought you to Meedan?\n\nA friend referred
      me to Meedan, and I was impressed with the positive social mission behind the
      company. As I get older, meaningful work is more and more important to me, and
      I appreciate that my efforts at Meedan contribute to a better world. :)\n\n###
      5. What's a project you're excited about right now?\n\nIt's not public yet,
      but there are some developments which will greatly scale up Meedan's services
      and infrastructure. The challenges associated with deploying new features and
      scaling them up are both interesting and rewarding!\n\nAnother aspect of my
      work involves securing the applications and systems used by Meedan. Information
      security is a complex and dynamic field; I enjoy that the challenges never end.
      It has been enlightening and fulfilling to tackle these issues for Meedan.\n\n###
      6. Tell us some fun facts about Martin.\n\n- Many years ago I learned to code
      [PASCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) \"Pascal
      programming language\") on an IBM PC compatible my dad used for work. It had
      a TURBO button that boosted the CPU to 12Mhz!\n- My wife and I raised horses,
      goats, and chickens on a farm in Oregon for 13 years. I miss the animals, but
      I don't miss mucking stalls or bucking hay bales.\n- When I was young and invincible
      I loved to free climb in [Eldorado Canyon, Colorado.](https://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/EldoradoCanyon
      \"Eldorado Canyon State Park website\") I still enjoy rappelling (with a rope)
      :)"

    body: "Meedan is excited to have Fiona Mati on board as our Customer Success Manager!
      Learn more about her in the short Q&A below.\n\n### 1. What has been your experience
      before you joined Meedan? \n\nI have been fortunate enough to work in startup
      spaces that linked technology to consumers in the Global South, mainly in renewable
      energy. My earliest similar role was as a Product Support Manager for a B2B
      technology company that enabled unbanked customers to purchase solar energy
      products using mobile money, incrementally. This was at a time when [solar products
      were new](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/off-grid-solar-power-comes-of-age-in-kenya-2237258#:~:text=grid%20solar%20industry.-,Market%20penetration%20of%20off%2Dgrid%20solar%20in%20Kenya%20has%20increased,financing%20from%20the%20World%20Bank.
      \"Solar power comes to Kenya\") and also [M-Pesa mobile payments were not widely
      available to all.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21420357/kenya-mobile-banking-unbanked-cellphone-money
      \"M-Pesa mobile payments not accessible in Kenya\") Creating and managing the
      Knowledge Base for sales agents and end-users was a steep learning curve for
      me. I realised that knowledge can either make or break consumer acceptance of
      new technologies.\n\n### 2. Tell us about an exciting and insightful experience
      that has shaped your perspective and work.\n\nSeveral years ago, I worked at
      a [biotech startup that developed and launched East and Central Africa’s first
      locally manufactured organic mosquito repellent candle.](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00032222/
      \"New organic mosquito repellant\") We had many challenges, first regulatory
      and then convincing retailers to stock the product. The first product did not
      pass all tests, so we had to go back to the lab and rework the product formula.
      By then, we had run out of money so it was not possible to hire someone to carry
      out the tests. I wound up doing the tests at the University of Nairobi Bio-chem
      lab myself - even though in school chemistry was my worst subject! Eventually
      we got certified, thankfully. \n\nSomehow, such experiences have been a running
      theme in my career, having to deal with new challenges while maintaining composure.
      I have learned that bugs are actually a good thing, as technology cannot progress
      otherwise. Tenacity is also important.\n\n### 3. What is the startup ecosystem
      like in Nairobi? What are the strengths and what gaps do you see?\n\nApart from
      South Africa, I would say that [Nairobi is the tech hub of sub-saharan Africa.](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/technology/kenya-ranked-top-tech-hub-in-sub-saharan-africa-2261046
      \"Kenya ranked top tech hub in Africa\") This has also been enhanced by the
      proliferation of mobile phones and money. I think M-Pesa was the first mobile
      money tool made widely available to all, which has also made things much easier.\n\nIn
      terms of gaps, I would name the [social inequalities that still exist, particularly
      to do with access to quality education.](https://theconversation.com/how-to-keep-kenyan-children-in-school-longer-its-not-only-about-money-157461
      \"Inequitable access to education in Kenya\") \n\n### 4. What brought you to
      Meedan?\n\nWhen I applied to Meedan, I actually wrote: ‘*If there was ever a
      time that fact-checking was required, it is most definitely now!*’\n\nWith COVID-19
      locking us down, even before I saw the ad for this role, I was actually getting
      very concerned about the volumes of misinformation being shared on WhatsApp
      groups. At the time it was all about fake-cures or COVID-19 denialism, and this
      was being shared by people that I respected. I realised that until we solve
      how to manage misinformation, anything else cannot work. The way to do that
      is to ensure that we are knowledgeable about these issues, and are enabled to
      make informed decisions about the content we share.\n\n### 5. What's a project
      you're excited about right now?\n\nI am excited about how we are making [Check’s
      Knowledge Base](https://help.checkmedia.org/en/collections/1929125-check \"Knowledge
      base for Check product\") and support communications more accessible. Firstly,
      translations will have a net positive impact on our partners' use of [Check.](https://meedan.com/check
      \"Check product page\") We have also been experimenting with new ways on how
      to keep everyone updated on what's happening, not just with newsletters which
      also exciting. As we grow, I am also extremely enthusiastic about how we can
      make the onboarding experience more seamless for new [Check](https://meedan.com/check
      \"Check Produce page\") users. \n\n### 6. Tell us some fun facts about Fiona.\n\nBefore
      the pandemic, I really enjoyed travelling and can't wait until everything gets
      back to normal. During the pandemic, I have become a balcony gardener and nothing
      excites me more than eating what I harvest. A great thing about being a Meedani
      is that with our distributed colleagues, I have been trying out different recipes!\n"

      initiative in the Philippines which saw three journalism schools and 11 media
      partners join hands to address misinformation in the country’s midterm elections.
      Tsek.ph brought together media partners such as Verafiles, Rappler and ABS-CBN
      News and academic partners such as University of the Philippines and Ateneo
      de Manila University. This collaboration between fact-checkers, regional media,
      academicians and researchers was an attempt to pool limited resources and expertise,
      address misinformation at speed and scale and plug the gap between fact-checking
      and research at a crucial event such as an election. To bring together a diverse
      group of entities with different working styles and goals was no easy task.
      Despite the challenges, Tsek.ph produced over 100 fact-checks and is a reference
      case study for other collaborative fact-checking initiatives. '

      In 2019 Meedan [supported](https://meedan.com/blog/how-meedan-supported-three-reporting-initiatives-in-asia/) [Tsek.ph](https://tsek.ph/about), a [collaborative fact-checking initiative in the Philippines](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/tsek-ph-new-fact-checking-collaboration-in-the-philippines-491f3bfdb1f9) which saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners join hands to address misinformation in the country's midterm elections.

      Tsek.ph brought together media partners such as [Verafiles](https://verafiles.org/), [Rappler ](https://www.rappler.com/)and [ABS-CBN News](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news) and academic partners such as [University of the Philippines](https://up.edu.ph/) and [Ateneo de Manila University](http://www.ateneo.edu/about). This collaboration between fact-checkers, regional media, academicians and researchers was an attempt to pool limited resources and expertise, address misinformation at speed and scale and plug the gap between fact-checking and research at a crucial event such as an election. To bring together a diverse group of entities with different working styles and goals was no easy task. Despite the challenges, Tsek.ph produced over 100 fact-checks and is a reference case-study for other collaborative fact-checking initiatives.

      In 2021, Meedan is supporting yet another consortium of fact-checkers.[ Ekta - a consortium of six fact-checking groups](https://ekta-facts.com/) in India has come together to address misinformation around the Legislative Assembly elections at the state level and other issues. As we embarked on this endeavour, we spoke to [Yvonne Chua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvonne-chua-60/?originalSubdomain=ph), Associate Professor at University of the Philippines and a leading participant of Tsek.ph, to revisit the lessons learned out of the experience. Here are the key takeaways.

      __1.  Assigning neutral parties to leadership is key to successful collaboration__

      Media partnerships are rare. It is natural for newsrooms to look for non-competitors as partners. Thus, for successful collaborations among newsrooms and fact-checkers in projects such as election monitoring, it is important to manage rivalry. Tsek.ph chose to assign neutral parties such as academics and universities to take the lead.

      __2.  Build consensus on targets, the degree and duration of collaboration__

      For groups chasing tight deadlines and following different working and editorial styles, it is very important to set the scope of the collaboration and to have some common guidelines and standards. Tsek.ph agreed on producing one fact-check per partner per week for 12 weeks during the election period and to share content on the common website, but not necessarily to cross check each other's work. The common ground was the International Fact Checking Network's guidelines, same rating systems and synchronised promotion on social media.

      __3.  Regular check-ins for coordination and dedicated teams for conflict disputes__ 

      To strengthen coordination, Tsek.ph had project and editorial coordinators and conducted regular meetings. The initiative also had a technical committee for running the website and an oversight committee comprising academics to address internal disputes. A dedicated lawyer was also present to address any concerns of copyright, protection of fact-checkers and enforcement of MOU and protocols.

      __4.  Collaboration enhances collective credibility__ 

      Though the participating groups held varying reputations and acceptance among different communities, Tsek.ph was able to build a collective credibility. Here is a statement from a reader: 

      *'I noticed that when I am able to refer to the source as Tsek.ph, the response is quiet acceptance. When the fact-check bears certain organizations' names that the President (Duterte) has overtly attacked..., the diehard supporters immediately disparage the result of such fact-check. Attaching the Tsek URL [to] the fact-check...done by [a specific partner] seemed to be all that was needed to give credence to the results.'*

      __5.  Start early and dedicate one or two team members from each group to the collective__

      In its post-election assessment, participating newsrooms pointed out drawbacks and scope for improvement. They felt the project started late, it lacked people capacity and election coverage of newsrooms in the social media age was still traditional. They also found that not having dedicated team members from each newsroom affected the degree of involvement of groups and when decision making rested on uninvolved newsroom editors, the practical issues of running the initiative was often ignored. For future collaborations Tsek.ph considered it important to cross-check collective content, have a pool of full-time editors for the initiative and conduct pre-trainings for all participants.

      Tsek.ph concluded its effort with a pop-up newsroom on the day of the election. That day saw greater degree and smoother collaboration than what was observed in previous weeks, indicating that focused and unified goals can enhance collaboration and traverse differences.

      Fact-checkers in India have been on guard against misinformation long before the 2021 Legislative Assembly election schedules were announced in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Over the past few months, they have observed a plethora of misinformation coming back in different forms and languages. Some claims, images and videos gain more traction than others and are often ones with communal misinformation and which denigrate political opponents.

      In this blogpost, members of the Ekta consortium share their insights from the experience of addressing misinformation around the 2021 Assembly elections and strategies adopted to make fact-checking efforts more effective during this time.

      __1.  What kind of misinformation have you tackled so far in relation to the ongoing Assembly elections in India? What is the most viral election story you've addressed so far?__

      Misinformation related to the Assembly elections started circulating even before the election schedule was declared. For fact-checkers addressing misinformation, most of the stories came from West Bengal. Old images of protests and rallies, unrelated and doctored videos, videos from India's neighbouring country Bangladesh, [fake election surveys](https://factcheck.afp.com/fake-survey-falsely-purports-project-winners-west-bengal-elections) and false news of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being hacked that had already been debunked in the past --- misinformation took different forms and appeared in different formats. Fact-checkers have also debunked [claims of political leaders](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/rahul-gandhi-highest-unemployment-in-assam-fact-check) in which they misrepresent data or quote wrong figures to present a picture of a particular state which is not entirely true.

      Some content garnered more attention than others. Members of Ekta also observed a rise in communal twists to the misinformation that went viral online. Here are the most viral pieces of misinformation, according to Ekta members.

      __AFP Fact Check__: A [deceptively edited video](https://factcheck.afp.com/clip-indian-politicians-campaign-speech-2019-has-been-deceptively-edited) of Assam politician Badruddin Ajmal's alongside a claim to turn the state of Assam into an Islamic state if his coalition comes to power.

      __BOOM Live__: After West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee allegedly injured her foot during campaigning in Nandigram, several images went viral with claims that she faked her injury. The narrative was supported with [flipped ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/no-mamata-banerjee-did-not-fake-her-injury-viral-pic-is-flipped-12387)and [edited ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/west-bengal-assembly-election-2021-fake-image-fact-check-nandigram-incident-morphed-image-viral-as-mamata-banerjee-faking-injury-12347)images, [old](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/old-image-peddled-as-mamata-banerjees-injured-leg-12312), [unrelated ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/mamata-banerjee-west-bengal-old-image-soumitra-chatterjee-funeral-bandaged-foot-west-bengal-assembly-elections-2021-nandigram-12302)photos of leg injury and images of Banerjee during old campaigns.

      __Factly__: Though there were no major elections in Telangana, the most viral piece of misinformation in the state was about an [alleged promise of financial assistance to Rohingya refugees](https://ekta-facts.com/blog-posts/morphed-images-unrelated-videos-and-fake-election-surveys-what-weve-seen-so-far-during-2021-state-elections-in-india#) in West Bengal BJP Manifesto.

      __Vishvas News__: [A morphed image ](https://www.vishvasnews.com/politics/narendra-modi-and-amit-shah-did-not-wear-islamic-skull-caps-viral-image-is-morphed/)of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Shah wearing skull caps was shared widely on social media in relation to West Bengal elections.

      __WebQoof__: Trending Twitter hashtags such as #StandWithBengalHindus were often used to push misinformation. There were also [pictures from Bangladesh and Pakistan](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/images-from-pakistan-bangladesh-viral-as-atrocities-on-hindus-in-bengal) to claim that Hindus were not safe in West Bengal.

      __2.  Are there certain trends, patterns or formats of election-related misinformation that you're seeing across states and languages?__

      __AFP Fact Check__: The disinformation pattern has been largely from one party targeting another, with edited and morphed images, doctored video clips and[ fake opinion polls](https://factcheck.afp.com/fake-survey-falsely-purports-project-winners-west-bengal-elections). We've been monitoring fan pages of the ruling party as well as the opposition party, but we've been seeing many trends of false news in the right-wing pages.

      __BOOM Live__: We observed a trend (in case of West Bengal) of [fake opinion polls](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/west-bengal-election-2021-bjp-tmc-ipac-leaked-survey-mamata-banerjee-nandigram-suvendu-adhikari-dilip-ghosh-letter-jp-nadda-intelligence-bureau-fake-news-12570), [surveys ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/fake-kolkatatv-opinion-poll-claims-suvendu-adhikaris-win-in-nandigram-12579)and [letters ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/bengal-polls-morphed-abp-clipping-claims-tmcs-win-12626)attributed to prominent party leaders being passed off as genuine.

      __Factly__: During any major election, misinformation, especially those related to either the prominent leaders or parties, is usually shared across states in multiple languages. Even though there is no major election in the Telangana state except for an assembly by-election, most of the viral election misinformation from poll-bound states has surfaced here as well. In fact we observed that a few stories went more viral here than in the poll bound states. One certain trend we have seen across the states is a constant rise in communal misinformation and that one party is favouring one particular religion over the other.

      __WebQoof__: We have noticed that there is a lot of [communal misinformation](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/posts-falsely-claiming-brahmin-man-thrashed-by-muslims-west-bengal-resurface) around the elections. We have debunked several claims which involves blame games for [appeasement politics ](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/bjp-shares-clipped-video-of-mamata-reciting-islamic-verses)by certain parties.

      __3.  Do you see any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on election-related misinformation?__

      __AFP Fact Check__: We've seen COVID-related misinformation, but haven't come across its impact on election-related misinformation.

      __BOOM Live__: While election-related misinformation covers the major chunk of misinformation, several [myths of COVID-19](https://www.boomlive.in/coronavirus-outbreak/fake-message-of-covid-19-cure-found-by-pondicherry-student-revived-12603) and [lockdown ](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/fake-news-fact-check-yogi-adityanath-uttar-pradesh-lockdown-covid-19-old-video-12409)that were debunked earlier made a comeback amid the raging second wave.

      __Factly__: While there was constant misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we haven't seen much of its impact on election-related misinformation, except that there was misinformation on the prices and availability of the vaccine which was used either to credit or discredit the government. With the recent surge in the COVID-19 cases, we are coming across allegations against few states on their failure to handle the surge in cases and the distribution of vaccines.

      __WebQoof__: We haven't seen a direct impact of the pandemic on election-related misinformation, per se. However, there have been a lot of old claims around COVID-19, which are now recirculating in the light of the current surge. We have also noticed misinformation around vaccines.

      __4.  Are there any new strategies that you've adopted to tackle misinformation in the election season?__

      __AFP Fact Check__:  We've been monitoring hashtags on Twitter and surveiling political fan pages and groups on Facebook of both opposition and ruling parties through CrowdTangle.

      __BOOM Live__: We are monitoring hashtags on Twitter for election-related narratives that are often led by misinformation.

      __Factly__: Except for keeping a constant eye out towards trends across various states, there hasn't been much of a change in our strategies.

      __WebQoof__: Other than monitoring trends on Twitter and monitoring CrowdTangle, we are trying to identify pieces of misinformation on Telegram.

    description: "Since 2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate
      the information bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and
      the journalism and fact-checking communities that need to get the information
      accurately and quickly.\n\nTo our community, we appreciate you, we are grateful
      for you, and our team of scientists is on-call for you as public health information
      response priorities shift and expand in 2021.   \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around

      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative."
    body: "To our incredible community of journalists, fact-checkers, podcasters,
      artists, and designers, and to the supporters that believed in the importance
      of collaborative responses to public health information inequities,\n\nThank
      you for making it possible to continue our public health response work. \n\nSince
      2018, the priority at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate the information
      bottlenecks between critical emerging scientific research and the journalism
      and fact-checking communities that need to get the information accurately and
      quickly. \n\nAs part of Meedan's Digital Health Lab, we are entering the second
      year of Health Desk project. Journalists and public health experts are continuing
      to work together in a time of crisis to get fast, reliable information to newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations around the world. With a rapid-response publishing
      process that borrows from two distinct industries—computer engineering and television
      news—our all-women team has written more than 200 explainers on COVID-19 topics
      for journalists and fact-checkers. \n\nIn local newsrooms from Delhi to Indianapolis,
      our work means that journalists do not have to scramble to find experts for
      comment every time COVID-19 news breaks. This alleviates an information bottleneck
      between critical emerging scientific research and public audiences that need
      to get the information accurately and quickly. \n\nOver the last year, we have
      developed scientific collaborations with communicators reaching millions around
      the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators at the Australian Science
      Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service to specifically help
      with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global alliance of Science
      Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team of public health
      scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google News Initiative.
      For updates, check out https://health-desk.org/vaccines/. \n\nWorking with you
      all over the last year has been an honor. The explainers, glossary terms and
      resources that our scientists have created to support communicators reaches
      audiences in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
      and North America. A sample content impact audit recently highlighted that 81%
      of the public health pieces that we have supported are on the front-page of
      Google search results for that topic in the region covered. That is such an
      essential metric as we think about the health information data voids that exist
      online, and how your work fills the information gaps that might otherwise largely
      contain problematic health misinformation.  \n\nWith a small team of scientists,
      researchers and communicators to influence diverse information spaces, these
      collaborations have shown the level of scale that can be made possible through
      syndication models for content dissemination, and strong collaborations across
      the public health and journalism fields. \n\nConversations with partner organizations
      have demonstrated how having access to experts can increase the subject matter
      that fact-checkers can cover, and therefore the content available online to
      the fact-checkers’and journalists' audiences. How can we work together to continue
      to fill public health information gaps across a variety of topics, ranging from
      vaccinations to infectious disease, from nutrition to reproductive health care?
      \n\nAt a presentation our team participated in about health misinformation hosted
      by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, health fact-checking
      was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”, and this is in direct
      response to the public health efforts of innovative communicators around the
      world. This includes our amazing partners: VERA Files, India Today, Nigeria
      Health Watch, Speak Up Africa, Boom Live, Africa Check, Animal Politico, and
      many more. We're grateful for your dedication to untangling complex questions
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic, fact-checking in an era of evolving science
      and moments of uncertainty. Your response to the misinfodemic is vital.  \n\nWe
      have also started to serve local community media outlets in the United States,
      including public broadcasters such as the Atlanta NPR-affiliate, WABE, and Indianapolis’
      public radio station WFYI, as well as large media organizations like the New
      York Times and Reuters. Through a broader network of public broadcasters in
      the United States, called America Amplified, COVID-19 questions answered by
      Meedan scientists are brought to local audiences across the country. Our media
      partnerships also include Tayo Help Desk, a resource that offers American Filipinos
      localized insights into COVID-19 information. \n\nWe thank each and every one
      of the journalists, fact-checkers, and communicators that have come to us for
      support, and are looking forward to continuing collaborations in 2021. \n\nHere's

    description: Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines
    body: "Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines thanks to a global
      alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s public health
      expert team, supported by the Google News Initiative.\n\nIn 2020 Meedan’s Digital
      Health Lab developed a [COVID-19 rapid information response initiative](https://health-desk.org/)
      to support our fact-checking and community media partners around the world,
      as they worked tirelessly to respond to COVID-19 misinformation. We were able
      to launch the initiative with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
      the Omidyar Network, and the Google News Initiative. In  2021, Meedan will be
      expanding the supported range of health topics as part of [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/),
      \ beginning with the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nOver the last year, the public health
      expert team working on Health Desk created a system for providing rapid responses
      to questions shared by fact-checkers, journalists, and other communicators around
      the world sharing vital COVID-19 information with different audiences. In response
      to health questions from fact-checkers and journalists (which you can always
      submit [here](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/ask-a-question), or via email directly
      to health@meedan.com), our team:\n\n- Reviews and summarizes the latest science
      for the topic that you are reporting on\n- Provides background and context for
      that topic as it relates to health research more generally, and\n- Gives you
      a list of important additional resources or sources you can review for your
      reporting or fact-checking\n\nBuilding off of this work, in partnership with
      the Australian Science Media Centre and their network of additional Science
      Media Centres around the world, the COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub will bring together
      multiple sources of evidence-based information on vaccines with material available
      in at least seven languages. The alliance will involve collaboration with organisations
      and experts from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
      region.\n\n“The threat of health misinformation has become a vector for the
      spread of infectious diseases and in the context of COVID-19, a  significant
      barrier to vaccine adherence. We see a networked approach to addressing information
      equity challenges as a critical public health need. With the global science
      community collaborating on providing fact-checkers and media partners with reliable,
      and time-sensitive health information that communicators can effectively report
      and respond to the vaccine information needs of their audiences. We are honored
      to work with the Australian Science Media Centre and their partner Science Media
      Centres on this critical initiative,” said Nat Gyenes, Director of the Meedan
      Digital Health Lab.\n\nThe media hub will include expert commentary and explainers
      that will help journalists and fact-checkers report on the science behind the
      COVID-19 vaccines being developed. \n\n“The COVID-19 vaccine development and
      roll-out are unprecedented. Fighting misinformation about this topic will require
      both targeting harmful hoaxes directly and supporting the crucial work of science
      beat reporters and fact-checkers informing the public. It is with this in mind
      that we’re thrilled to support the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub
      to help journalists access expertise rapidly and reliably”, said Alexios Mantzarlis,
      News and Information Credibility Lead, Google News Lab\n\n“The enormous impact
      of this pandemic has meant that scientists and pharmaceutical companies have
      had to go into overdrive to produce vaccines in record time. With so many vaccines
      in various stages of development, it can be very confusing for journalists and
      the public and this is where we hope to help,” said Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO
      of the AusSMC. “It’s now more critical than ever that we all have access to
      clear information about these vaccines as they are being developed”.\n\nIf you’re
      a fact-checker, journalist, community organizer or communicator working to respond
      to vaccine misinformation or strengthen vaccine adherence, and you’re interested
      in collaborating or learning more, please reach out to health@meedan.com, and
      check out our existing health information resources: [https://health-desk.org/](https://health-desk.org/),

    description: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance,
      the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool
      resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health
      emergencies in Africa.
    body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information
      since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been
      shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million
      times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African
      Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the
      United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.
      \n\nA large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and
      continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday.
      The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
      is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
      is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
      they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset
      of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies
      around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In
      health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to
      spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about
      their health and well-being, and a glut of information - an infodemic - with
      misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This
      crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop
      the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional
      Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the  Africa Infodemic Response Alliance
      \ will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines
      and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement
      efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.\n\nThe network is the
      first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional
      organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural
      science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect,
      disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.
      \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support
      journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based
      on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues. It also aims
      to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management
      strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists
      and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.\n\nThis
      initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that
      were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under
      the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe
      Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross
      and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the
      United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating
      and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check,
      PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
      public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
      for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
      ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
      can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab."

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America__, with localization of both text and accompanying
      visuals (thanks, to [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)
      and [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/)) __in 8 languages__
      prioritized by our partners \n- The __public health community__, including health
      literacy practitioners, __is eager and excited to get more involved__ in supporting
      local misinformation response efforts\n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-reuters](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4xgsZVcR02vLjnusBejbyo/189a7297d4d3b38964e5219f5af26ee4/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-reuters.jpg)\n<p

      using Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough
      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable

      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.
