    body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
      we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
      is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
      is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
      two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you
      have water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
      economies where most of the population live in [urban dense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html)
      areas the outcome of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to
      remember the power we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create
      new and inclusive pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts
      as a speaker and as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon
      in México, which occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n>
      \"Para cambiar los medios necessitamos cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media
      we will need to change it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO
      of Chicas Poderosas, at the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This
      speech set the tone for the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas
      an all-female digital media professinals network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn
      a historic building at the center of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican
      states got together for two days with the goal of creating multimedia projects
      on subjects relevant to their context and based on the current sexual assaults
      occurring in the country. \n\nTo get to this meeting spot you would have to
      first find yourself on a street right behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic
      church that is part of a series of buildings that stand today on top of what
      used to be The Templo Mayor, the heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event
      started, the women took pictures first of the stage and the speakers, but slowly
      as they started to chat with each other during the activities of the day, selfies
      emerged— a prelude to the professional relationships and friendships that were
      forged at these events. Despite the grey building, colors were abundant in Chicas
      banners, participant's hairs, [pañuelos](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2019/06/08/color-por-color-que-significan-los-24-panuelos-que-se-venden-en-las-calles-portenas/)
      and children's toys. \n\n\nA little girl was running between the participants'
      tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with her mother's camera.
      A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced and taken care of
      by the community. In Latin America there is an increasing number of women self
      identifying as [household heads](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/unequal-family-lives/families-in-latin-america/27F2E01B797AD1489A238BFDF2075F1C/core-reader),
      and as they become mothers the participation in professional events declines,
      as do career development opportunities. This effect is known as the [baby penalty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813
      \"Baby Penalty\"). The presence of kids in this event set a precedent for Chicas,
      and in 2020 all Mediathons will make clear in their calls to the community that
      mothers and children are welcome *(due to COVID-19 pandemic Mediathons will
      be held online)*. \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those
      of a call for action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist
      spaces, and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was
      composed of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers,
      and journalists. All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of
      diverse personalities: a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\n###
      The Mediathon Model: Building a community by building safe spaces\n\nTo ensure
      that the room was transformed into a safe space, [rules of behavior ](http://chicaspoderosas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Co%CC%81digo-Chicas-ES.pdf
      \"Chicas Code of conduct\")and engagement were shared as soon as the event began.
      Chicas defines a safe a place as one that is free of social, cultural, racial
      and sexual oppression. The material with the code of conduct was sent to the
      participants beforehand, and they were reminded by the organizers that they
      were always available to answer any questions and to help if something that
      violated the code or made them feel uncomfortable happened. A few members were
      defined as the go-to people for any woman that felt the code was violated. There
      were only a few men present, of those, most were working at the catering service
      and only a couple representing NGOs that were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons
      are made real thanks to Chicas volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in
      which they run an event. The team organizing it was composed of members that
      first started by attending or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around
      Latin America, which is a common way to get to know and be a part of the community.
      In this case, most of them were not from México City and had instead traveled
      from distant provinces. \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered
      around a contextualized issue, in this case, violence against women in México.
      The first segment involved local NGOs and communities presenting their work
      on gender violence, violence against women journalists, abortion and reproductive
      rights. After that, the participants decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate
      further, and teams formed around the multimedia projects. On the second day,
      \ women leaders in their field presented issues on which they are experts, such
      as online engagement, online security, and fact-checking tools (this last one
      was presented by a zombie-like me while I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX
      dry climate). After this, they worked on the projects with their mentors and
      at the end presented their multimedia projects and timelines.\n\nThe highlight
      of this experience was when one of the participants started presenting her project
      in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped, shouted and, safe to say, I had
      goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that systematically erased (and still
      does) the existence of the indigenous population, it was humbling to hear that
      ancient and important language. That woman speaking summed to me what Chicas
      is about: sharing and saving space for underrepresented voices that shape our
      communities. \n\n### One-month mentoring projects\n\nThe projects presented
      were about a myriad of subjects: abortion, sexuality, a radio community directed
      to indigenous women focusing on fighting gender violence in 6 different local
      languages, child and teenage pregnancies, masculinity and gender roles. \n\n[Here](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/historias-que-ponen-nuestras-vocesenalza-ad1b31907010)

      at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
      in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is
      working on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate,
      sustain and expand their community using digital tools. This year one of the
      initiatives we will be supporting Chicas is the [Conversaciones Poderosas en
      La Pandemia COVID-19](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/conversacionespoderosas-en-la-pandemia-de-covid-19-71daa8ea523f
      \"Conversaciones Poderosas\"), a space to talk about the various challenges
      that the pandemic presents on a professional and personal level for journalists,
      share ideas on how to face them and exchange points of view from different countries.
      The objective is to create a space of containment, learning and accompaniment
      for the community."

    body: |-
      "I'm going to the grocery store asap," my friend texted me a few weeks ago, at the peak of the confusion around COVID-19 in the US. He'd heard word from a friend of a friend that President Trump was going to declare a nationwide quarantine. The text came through with urgency and authority --- the President was going to invoke the Stafford Act, the National Guard was going to be called in, and no one would be allowed outside their homes for two weeks.

      It wasn't true, but it felt true, and it felt especially true in the early morning hours when I got the message. I could feel in my bones a sense of dread --- wait, maybe this time it's real? California and New York were already shutting down. President Trump did declare a national emergency using the Stafford Act. There were indeed [credible recommendations from epidemiologists](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-13/coronavirus-shopping-list-your-essential-quarantine-items) that we stock up for two weeks in case we need to quarantine. And the [National Guard had already been called](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814164923/new-york-state-deploys-national-guard-to-manage-coronavirus-in-nyc-suburb) into a number of outbreak zones in the United States.

      The problem comes in the shades of gray: the Stafford Act does grant enormous powers to the President, but [national quarantine is not one of them](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/19/fact-check-does-stafford-act-allow-trump-order-quarantine/2872743001/). The National Guard has been deployed, not to enforce anything remotely resembling martial law but instead to help with [cleaning, testing and food delivery](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21188088/coronavirus-national-guard-testing-food-cleaning-martial). Cities and states have indeed issued shelter-in-place orders, but [the federal government doesn't have direct power](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/825293201/a-president-is-not-able-to-order-a-national-quarantine-experts-say) over these. Around the world, we're indeed  seeing national lockdowns in places like India, China and Hungary, with tremendous implications on civil rights. In this context, it might not be unreasonable to think that a military-enforced quarantine might be coming for the United States.

      [A recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-text-messages-national-quarantine.html) pointed out that false and misleading information is part of an ongoing problem in the wake of the pandemic: "With the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the world, misinformation has followed suit," the article noted. It continues:

      Other [SMS] messages in recent weeks, reflecting the same pattern, have warned that New York City public transit would shut down last week (it's still running), or that the entire Pacific Northwest would be quarantined last week (also not true). At least one message said that President Trump would declare a national emergency within three days --- Mr. Trump declared the emergency on Friday, but that did not give him the power to impose a national quarantine.

      ![Meedan sms 2](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/Qad98m6x2PoDGg9WD0DaW/91f2f80e2539ad70eec5389dd59470c6/Meedan_sms_2.png)

      Over the past year, the misinformation research community has been sounding the alarm about deepfakes, [a form of synthetic media](https://lab.witness.org/projects/synthetic-media-and-deep-fakes/) (i.e., media made by artificial intelligence) wherein people are made to look like they're saying or doing something that they're not. In January of this year, as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was spreading across China and --- as we would later learn --- much of the world, [Facebook announced a ban on AI-generated videos](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-us-election). That same month, [William A. Galston at the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-seeing-still-believing-the-deepfake-challenge-to-truth-in-politics/) warned that "If AI is reaching the point where it will be virtually impossible to detect audio and video representations of people saying things they never said (and even doing things they never did), seeing will no longer be believing, and we will have to decide for ourselves---without reliable evidence---whom or what to believe."

      Galston wrote these words with an eye on the upcoming 2020 election in the US, but just a few months later, the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly placed the US election into the background of national conversations. Furthermore, the misinformation thriving now is not deepfakes but cheap fakes --- what [Data & Society researchers Britt Paris and Joan Donovan](https://datasociety.net/library/deepfakes-and-cheap-fakes/) define as "an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing." Cheap fakes can simply be miscontextualized videos, like one going viral on [WhatsApp purportedly showing panicked mobs in the Netherlands](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/03/13/monitoring-and-debunking-covid-19-panic-the-haarlem-aldi-hoax/). 

      But much of today's pandemic misinformation is proving to be even simpler: what I call text fakes --- the oldest form of media manipulation, made possible by the ability to put words on a page, or a screen, or spread it around rapidly on private messaging apps. 

      The text fake goes back to the days of scrolls and pamphlets. [The ancient Romans engaged in information combat](https://www.ft.com/content/aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6), using the literary implements of their time to spread disinformation and confusion. But it was the rise of moveable type in the 15th century that soon yielded pamphleteering as a popular medium for politics. As such, they became an early source of text fakes: "Cheap and made on the smallest sheets of paper," noted [one article in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-we-solved-fake-news-the-first-time), "pamphlets were written for attention and money. How do you get attention? Then, as now, successful strategies included exaggeration and hating others (in the pamphlets' case, Catholics). Elaborate conspiracy theories were popular, too." Essayist and pamphleteer Jonathan Swift famously observed that "falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after." 

      Much of the deepfake discussion in 2019 focused lagely on the content of synthetic media --- what the media shows, how to detect it, what it might say, how it might mislead. Cheap fakes and text fakes floating around private messaging apps and public social media are, alternatively, a reminder of the importance of the context of media --- the mental state of the recipient, the narrative discourse in media and the general public, the relationship between the person sending the message and the person(s) receiving it, the political situation in the region, and a variety of other factors that influence how we interpret a piece of content, whether it's a piece of text or a fully-manipulated video.

      The history of writing suggests that as more people gain access to writing tools and the ability to manipulate the written word, the more we see misinformation in text. We should expect the same of video, with the rise of video editing tools and synthetic media. Beware the text fake --- it's a powerful reminder that when content flies around the internet, our understanding of its context still comes limping after.

    body: "As global journalism grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of challenges
      to press freedom remain. But the crisis also presents an opportunity to reimagine
      media in a post COVID-19 world. In time with World Press Fredom Day, we are
      launching our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/),
      our community for non-profits and collectives working in the area of independent
      media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) in emerging economies.\n\nWith
      our mission to support global journalism, Meedan cares deeply about press freedom
      around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenges we’ve been
      monitoring and writing about through our [Checklist](https://meedan.com/checklist)
      newsletter. Some of the trends we’ve seen are deeply concerning:\n\n### Journalists
      are on the frontlines of the pandemic\nJournalists have been on the frontlines
      reporting the pandemic in different regions. Reporters have been going to hospitals
      and other hotspots where the risk of exposure to the virus and infection is
      very high. Several media outlets do not have or cannot provide proper personal
      protective equipment (PPE) for their staff. According to the [Committee for
      the Protection of Journalists (CPJ), there is risk of the pandemic impacting
      journalists’ physical health and psychological well-being](https://cpj.org/blog/2020/04/qa-us-photographers-navigate-a-new-reality-under-c.php).
      \ \n\n### Media jobs are facing historic losses\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not
      only exposed media workers to physical vulnerabilities, it has also decimated
      an already battered media sector, with many companies reducing hours, holding
      back salaries or simply sacking their media staff outright, according to the
      [South Asia Press Freedom Report](https://samsn.ifj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/States-of-Control-IFJ-SAPFR-2019-20.pdf).
      Shrinking revenue from advertisements, serious disruptions in circulation of
      newspapers and printed publications and a severe strain on limited revenues
      have resulted in a job crisis where reporters and journalists across the world
      are [experiencing pay cuts, reduced hiring and layoffs](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/here-are-the-newsroom-layoffs-furloughs-and-closures-caused-by-the-coronavirus/).
      \ \n\n### Democracies are undermining press freedom\n[Over the last two and
      a half months, the International Press Institute’s (IPI) COVID-19 tracker has
      documented a total of 162 different press freedom violations related to the
      coronavirus](https://ipi.media/covid19-media-freedom-monitoring/). These range
      from verbal or physical attacks on journalists to arrests, restrictions on access
      to information and media censorship. This has created a hostile and challenging
      environment for independent media and press freedom. Several agencies also note
      that the current pandemic has given states an opportunity to exercise greater
      control over the media. IPI has also documented 16 cases of ‘fake news’ laws
      either being passed with disproportionate penalties or used to take down content
      about the virus online. IPI notes that while some of these laws are sincere
      but ill-conceived, others appear to deliberately strengthen authoritarian regimes’
      arsenal against the press.\n \n### Local journalism is under threat\nDuring
      a pandemic, people need timely, reliable and unbiased news on local conditions,
      however, the absence of sustainable and robust business models and distribution
      networks for local news is making that increasingly difficult. [These newsrooms
      will have to make strategic shifts in their business models in order to survive
      the pandemic](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/how-local-news-can-survive-and-thrive-during-the-pandemic/).
      \n\n### Journalists grapple with misinformation during a pandemic\nIn times
      of a global pandemic, access to accurate and unbiased information about the
      disease becomes ever more important. It is critical for the media to share verified
      and reliable information. However, the widespread use of social media and other
      platforms to share unverified information, often without scientific proof, can
      be dangerous and life threatening in the current situation. [UN chief António
      Guterres noted](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity)
      that \"the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading,\" using a word coined by Meedan
      researchers.  [UNESCO is promoting two social media campaigns “to fight the
      infodemic of rumours and disinformation”](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373354_eng.locale=en).
      UNESCO has also created a COVID- 19 resource centre for media. This online platform
      aims to help journalists track false information regarding the pandemic and
      report on the crisis reliably and effectively, as encouraged by the theme of
      World Press Freedom Day 2020, “journalism without fear or favour”.\n\nAt the
      same time, as [Meedan board member Maria Ressa wrote recently](https://time.com/5820620/maria-ressa-coronavirus-democracy/),
      “The mission of independent journalism has never been as important as it is
      today, when decisions are being made without transparency. Now more than ever,
      facts matter. Truth matters. Checks and balances matter.” It’s vital that those
      working for media freedom around the world come together to re-envision what
      this can look like.\n\nIn time with World Press Freedom Day, Meedan is thrilled
      to launch our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
      The network is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
      working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
      (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin
      America (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA).\n\nOur partners
      from different regions will participate in the launch of the Check Global Network
      this week. The network will provide its members access to opportunities and
      forums for sharing, learning and reflection. The main activities will focus
      on capacity building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational
      development, providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be
      part of a growing impactful community."

    body: "This past Wednesday, three Meedanis had a chance to attend The Reboot’s
      Masterclass on “[Designing Collaborations for Urgent, Courageous Change](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/),”
      a 1.5-hour session on cross-sector collaboration. We will be sharing our team's
      insights for the other two sessions of this webinar series. \n\nAs the workshop
      describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse coalitions to
      advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts must draw on
      the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our activists,
      the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence of our
      media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the private
      sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work at the
      intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists, academics, policy
      researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale, and
      so this is a topic close to our heart. Here are three things we learned from
      speakers [Panthea Lee, Founder and Executive Director of The Reboot](https://reboot.org/team/panthea-lee/)
      and [Chelsey Lepage, Associate Director of Programs](https://reboot.org/team/chelsey-lepage/):\n\n__Program
      and initiative design can look like agile product development, starting with
      the problem and people.__\n\nFocus on the problem first, invite fewer subject
      matter experts to the table and more the people that need the solution. Chelsey
      Lepage suggested framing the problem as a hunch to make everyone collaborating
      more comfortable when giving inputs. It was insightful to see design and product
      development concepts applied to program work in such a clear manner.\n\nIn agile
      product development, defining a good problem statement is always a challenge,
      and if it is not well-crafted, the user need (solution) will be unmet. Making
      sure the team and users are involved in the framing is the key. Otherwise, all
      those hours spent on meetings, coding and design will have resulted in something
      —  in this context, an initiative — that will never be used. \n\nDuring the
      webinar, other concepts drew on that shared parallel such as “success criteria''.
      Knowing what criteria must be met so it is considered a success and how you
      will measure and identify it is also a core part of the product development
      cycle. They are embedded in the user stories, so every feature built brings
      value and is solving a user need. In program design this was presented in the
      same way: how will you know that an objective in your program was met? What
      will success look like? The Reboot’s webinar made clear that such as it is in
      product development, a fruitful initiative design is impossible without true
      collaboration.\n\n— *Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America*\n\n__When
      developing a collaboration, work on building relationships before focusing on
      the technical challenges you hope to address together.__\n\nWhen launching or
      developing a collaboration, the webinar leads emphasized the importance of thinking
      about collaborations as ongoing journeys, with interpersonal relationships to
      develop and strengthen before technical challenges become the focus. Presenters
      emphasized that this happens with multiple touchpoints to strengthen the collaboration,
      to build social cohesion, and to have “conversations as humans first, and as
      representatives of an organization second”. As organizations work to develop
      strong and long-term collaborations, the webinar emphasized that relationship
      building early on can help strengthen the interpersonal accountability that
      can help with achieving success as a team. \n\nOver the last decade, Meedan
      has prioritized the development of a global community of contributors and collaborators,
      working together to build impactful projects at the intersection of information
      equity and accessibility, global journalism and digital literacy. This webinar
      emphasized an important value that we as an organization hold dear: as we continue
      to develop collaborations to address the pressing global challenges of today,
      we’re committed to centralizing the focus on all forms of expertise, ensuring
      that all stakeholders are part of collaboration design, and strengthening the
      foundational relationships that enable success and maximize the impact we can
      realize together. \n\n— *Nat Gyenes, Senior Program Manager and Lead, Digital
      Health Lab*\n\n__Living Expertise is a valuable form of expertise that’s often
      overlooked in favor of formal training and education.__\n\nThe webinar discussed
      the concept of Living Experts, defined as those who “understand the lived experience
      of a problem or context.” These experts sit alongside a diversity of perspectives
      in cross-sector collaboration, such as technical experts, decision makers, implementers
      and allies. “Take an expensive view of ‘expertise’,” noted the webinar leaders.
      At Check Global and in [Meedan programs](https://meedan.com/projects) overall,
      we aim to center different forms of expertise, and this framework made a lot
      of sense for how we try to implement our initiatives.\n\n— *Mina Xiao, Operations*"

    body: "In July 2018, I traveled to Zimbabwe to join The Carter Center to work
      with civil society organizations and newsrooms on tracking and addressing misinformation
      around the first harmonized elections in the country after Robert Mugabe stepped
      down.\n\nWhen I arrived in Zimbabwe, election-related propaganda was all over
      news media and social media. As an Egyptian, I was all too familiar with this
      kind of information ecosystem: mainstream media is owned by the state, and its
      goal is simply to amplify and spread one side of the story — that of those in
      power. Wandering the streets of Harare, it was impossible not to notice the
      dominance of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front
      ([Zanu-PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU%E2%80%93PF)) in its use of posters
      and billboards. Zimbabwe’s digital streets — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, were
      similarly flooded with pro-Zanu-PF content: memes, articles, and videos all
      designed and spread to support the long-time ruling party.\n\nThough we had
      worked for more than a decade in North Africa, at the time our work in sub-saharan
      Africa was in its early days. Meedan was in the middle of developing a network
      in East Africa, which included launching a partnership with [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)
      to support the fact-checking ecosystem in the region. Fact-checkers at PesaCheck
      integrated Meedan’s open source toolkit, [Check](http://meedan.com/en/check),
      into their workflows and verified statements from public figures in Kenya, Uganda
      and Tanzania. \n\nComing to Zimbabwe in 2018, we found a nation and people full
      of hope and looking for the political change needed to address decades of corruption
      and the challenges of [their brutal economic situation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview).
      In an earlier [post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
      this year, I wrote about how Robert Mugabe’s retirement from his presidency
      in 2017 opened up the region to a new era. Our invitation to join the Carter
      Center team in Zimbabwe to help partners monitor and assess the role of online
      mis and disinformation represented [the first time in more than a decade that
      international election observers](https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/commonwealth/africa/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-and-election-observation-missions/)
      were able to monitor an election in Zimbabwe, and as such certainly represented
      the first online election media analysis effort there. . In this spirit the
      2018 Zimbabwe presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections (harmonized
      elections) took place on July 30, 2018.\n\n[Our collaborations in Zimbabwe](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
      included the fact-checking initiative [ZimFact](https://zimfact.org/) as well
      as the Centre for Innovation & Technology ([CITE](http://www.cite.org.zw/about-us/)),
      a group in South Zimbabwe that supports initiatives led by youths, journalists,
      and designers. \n\n\n### A new phase of Check Global: Post-Election Narratives\n\nThe
      Kenya elections in 2017 were “marred by serious human rights violations, including
      unlawful killings and beatings by police during protests and house-to-house
      operations” according to[ Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse).
      Under those circumstances, Check Global fact-checking partners CITE (in Zimbabwe)
      \ and PesaCheck  (in Kenya) continued to verify social media evidence after
      the elections and focused on how to hold politicians accountable to their constituencies.\n\nCurrently,
      PesaCheck in Kenya is building a prototype of Wajibisha, which means “to hold
      accountable,” a promise tracker with a focus on fact-checking budgetary promises
      and election promises, for initial deployment in Kenya and Uganda. Promises
      are logged on Meedan 's Check platform covering the following thematic areas
      - Health, Housing, Jobs, Governance, Environment, Traffic Management and Social
      Inclusion (Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities). Updates on the progress
      of delivery on these promises will then reflect on the main promise tracker
      website, which is not yet available to the general public but will be soon.\n\nEric
      Mugendi, the managing editor of PesaCheck, explains their use of Check:: \n\n>
      \"Check as a platform has enabled us to collaborate both within and outside
      our organization to fact-check and verify content. Our team is distributed in
      three countries, and we work on different platforms. Check allows us to keep
      track of what everyone is doing, and ensures that our work is done to the same
      standard. We are exploring new ways to use the platform, and the most promising
      one so far is in keeping track of promises by elected figures. \"\n\nIn Zimbabwe,
      CITE is working on [The Digital Media for Accountability Project](https://www.cite.org.zw/category/factcheckzw/).
      This is an innovative project that combines digital technology, journalistic
      fact-checking skills and capacity building to promote social accountability
      at the local government level. Focusing mainly on Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second
      capital city, the project aims to track and check statements made by the Bulawayo
      City Council. CITE continues to use Check in their daily fact-checking workflow
      to provide citizens with timely, relevant and accurate information on issues
      of local governance, service delivery and public resources management. \n\nCalling
      Check’s workflow “harmonious” and “intuitive,” Sean Ndlovu, co-founder of CITE,
      said: \n\n> \"The Check platform has allowed us at CITE to be able to follow
      up on announcements, promises and proclamations made by local authorities in
      Zimbabwe in a systematic and archival way. The Check platform also allows us
      to collaborate as a team by assigning tasks to each other in a seamless way
      thus helping the team to report on claims in a simple and standardised format.
      \"\n\n### Check Global intersections with different projects at Meedan\n\nWe’ve
      also expanded our work with our current Check Global partners in East Africa
      in that it  is also feeding the capacity of our Claims and Memes Database (CMDb)
      project. The CMDb project was possible by the generous support of Open Tech
      Fund (OTF), and it's an API-accessible repository of fact checked claims and
      debunked visual misinformation from internet repressive countries, where disinformation
      and social network manipulation have become key censorship strategies. As we
      witnessed visual misinformation travel between Kenya and Zimbabwe during the
      elections, we realized the importance of creating an annotated and verified
      database for claims and memes. \n\nIn July 2019, I was honored to travel to
      Kenya to participate in a collaborative pop-up newsroom to counter misinformation
      during the Kenyan census. This effort was organized by Meedan and supported
      by Article 19. During this pop-up workshop we collected, annotated, and verified
      Kenyan memes based on the census.\n\n### What's new for Check Global in East
      Africa in 2020?\n\nAs the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced the COVID-19
      outbreak as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
      and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied
      across platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual
      information around the virus.\n\nEast African countries face different challenges
      on many levels, not only in terms of weakened [public health services](https://time.com/5816299/coronavirus-africa-ventilators-doctors/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=world_&linkId=85995855)
      and infrastructure, but also rising [mis/disinformation on social media platforms](https://www.article19.org/resources/coronavirus-new-article-19-briefing-on-tackling-misinformation/),
      lacking [access to public records and information](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/why-access-to-information-on-covid-19-is-crucial-to-persons-with-disabilities-in-africa/),
      [severe cutbacks to free speech](https://ifex.org/covid-19-in-africa-right-to-information-another-casualty-with-spike-in-attacks-on-journalists/),
      [internet and telecom accessibility issues](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-internet-is-making-stay-at-home-difficult-for-africans/a-53048013),
      and worsening [civil rights violations](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/cipesa-submission-to-un-special-rapporteur-spotlights-rights-concerns-in-africas-covid-19-response/).\n\n__Meedan
      launched [new COVID-19 microgrants](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/)__
      to support independent media projects in Africa. Our goal was to support journalists,
      activists and citizen journalists to explore open source investigations and
      verification storytelling. \n\nWe are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely
      in East Africa with our partners, with whom we are discussing and adapting new
      ways of virtual training programs that, while it will no longer require the
      physical attendance of participants, will continue to keep them involved. \n\n[CITE](https://www.cite.org.zw/)
      just launched an online learning platform '[Funda](http://funda.cite.org.zw/)'
      (meaning 'learn' in [Ndebele](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ndebele-Zimbabwean-people)),
      relying on online learning resources from [Nawa Media](https://nawamedia.org/courses/),
      a separate Check Global project that brings together journalism students across
      five countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) across North Africa,
      West Asia to instill the next generation of Arab-speaking journalists with open-source
      investigation tools, fact-checking skills, and an acumen for digital and media
      literacy. \n\nSeparately, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) is creating two
      massive open online courses (MOOC), one on general fact-checking processes using
      Check and another on how to build Promise Tracking using Check. PesaCheck will
      conduct virtual training using these modules with four different newsrooms in
      Kenya.\n\n\nThis increased inter-partner collaboration, not only manifested
      in East Africa, has accelerated and strengthened Meedan’s aspirations to bring
      our partners together within the [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
      The Network  virtually launched on May 5, 2020.. \n\n\n### Events\n\nIn light
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not attending events this year, as a number
      of the conferences we typically attend have been canceled. That said, we are
      moving this energy online and hosting  a series of online conversations. Please
