      So, when the dust settled on Electionland (before the awards for that project started to drop from the sky) we recognized that the 1000 journalists that were working into our software, doing annotation work, classifying content were completely disconnected from the machinery. We called for: “common media verification standards and APIs, and they should work to develop a shared visual language to expose the work of media verification and fact-checking professionals. This means developing a new schema for verification.”

      This found its form in the Credibility Coalition, an initiative we started with Hacks/Hackers that has grown in 2017 to bring Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the W3C behind this effort to develop and test third party signals that can be used to describe link, claim, and image credibility. It is a daunting and ambitious project and amounts to an effort to create a machine readable context layer above the web.

      Also in 2017 we partnered with Dig Deeper Media to start Pop-Up Newsroom, to seed and launch collaborative reporting initiatives in different contexts and countries around the world. To date, much of our work has been focused on the challenge of limiting the spread and impact of viral misinformation around elections, and creating media projects that serve audiences through provision of credible content, debunks, and media literacy content. Pop-Up Newsroom was deployed in the US at Texas State’s J-School where we ran a training program for young journalists working on the Documenting Hate project.

      With our brilliant partners at Birmingham City University we created the first CheckCon where friends like Katherine Maher, Lina Attalah, Jillian York and many more inspired a global gathering of media and internet geeks with their ideas on the future of open knowledge and open tools.

      We have witnessed increasing global demand for access to Check from global civil society and independent media. For example, following Rappler’s implementation of Check in the Philippines, IFCN signatory VERA Files (also in the Philippines) requested access and are now using Check as their primary fact-checking workbench. We ran two projects with Hong Kong University using Check and Bridge to monitor and translate Weibo content. Bellingcat has used Check to open crowdsource geolocation of imagery for Interpol. Syrian Archive and the Berkeley Human Rights Center conducted digital investigations that conclusively showed the provenance of chemical weapons attacks in Syria. CrossCheck and Electionland both ran on Check and picked up OJAs (Online Journalism Awards). And, following PesaCheck’s use of Check in the Kenyan election in November 2017, the Media Council of Kenya and groups in Zimbabwe (CITE, ZimFact) have partnered with us.

      There is no question that this past seven years of our work has been a single long, and, from this vantage point, prescient, arc to the epicenter of the internet freedom and access issues that offer a serious threat to democratic systems around the world. We take this to be very much the challenge of our time, and a challenge that does not just impact political participation, but also public health, education, environment, and virtually every area of online discourse. We did not envision seven years ago that our idea for addressing verification in service of raising citizen voices would have put us in the middle of the effort to improve the very infrastructure of the web, but we are extremely proud that we have navigated our work to this point and are very grateful for the huge contributions to our work in 2017 from our funders, partners, and, most importantly, our users.

      In the next year we expect to work with amazing partners like Yemen Archive, Rappler, Animal Politico, Chicas Poderosas, AfricaCheck, Witness, and Dig Deeper in election settings, digital investigations, and crisis response efforts. Most importantly, we will pursue this ambitious agenda with an organizational commitment to place diversity, kindness, and support for the well-being of our team members and partners at the core of everything we do.

      Until Soon,
      EAB

      [The Credibility Coalition](http://credibilitycoalition.org/) is a diverse, interdisciplinary community committed to improving information ecosystems and media literacy through transparent and collaborative exploration. Rather than jointly deciding whether an article is “credible” or “not credible” or endorsing any single index or evaluation of credibility, the Credibility Coalition fosters the development of a framework around which credibility can be discussed and interpreted.

      Our goal is to provide a range of indicators that can be used by a person — or a system — to gauge if an article can inform or educate that person (or whoever the audience is likely to be).

    content: "So, recognizing this challenge, we did a little daydreaming. Could we
      perhaps write software to programmatically generate the document? We have a
      corpora of previous years notes for training data, and in 2018, with the generous
      support of the AI fund, we brought bots into Check. The thinking was that we
      might just toss our g-docs (9,718) and travel receipts (653), Slack messages
      (144,661), tweets (too many), posts (not enough), emails (embarrassing, number
      withheld), conference talks (17), proposals (15) and board packets (4) into
      Check and set the AnnualNoteBot to work. We imagined the AI might generate a
      thoughtful, inspiring, and eloquent overview of the wonderful things that happened
      at Meedan during another arguably awful year for the planet and, particularly,
      for the digital surface of it that we have devoted our lives and this organization
      to improving. \n\nAlas, our end of grant report to the AI Fund will not include
      any mention of the failed AnnualNoteBot, nor will this note include any algorithmically
      generated content.  \n\nInstead, it falls to me, with all my human biases deployed,
      to share with my assessment across the continuing story of this organization.
      Working on tools and programs supporting human rights investigators, election
      monitoring, and collaborative media annotation we have put our theory of change
      into motion with significant and award-winning results. In 2018 our team of
      16 and our amazing organizational partners created: election media monitoring
      projects that pushed the boundaries of rigorous classification and creative
      memetic response to disinformation (Pop-Up Newsroom); structured data standards
      that generate machine readable signals from such work and might provide an early
      model for researching and defining standards that could help to bring a contextual
      layer of credibility signals to the web (CredCo); and, the open source software
      that keeps all of this work organized (Check)."

    content: "In the past decade we have had some very successful programs, and certainly
      these have had impact on policy, spurred new technical approaches to collaborative
      translation and verification, and powered serious investigative journalism efforts,
      but in 2018 I think we actually helped change the world. In Mexico, the Verificado
      team from Animal Politicò, AJ+ Español, and  more than 80 media partners had
      a significant impact on the quality of information flowing through FB, WhatsApp,
      Twitter, and the interwebs broadly during Mexico’s historic election. This week
      a Mexican citizen came to me in tears with his thanks for that project - that
      is impact. It was the beginning of us taking what had been very technical and
      assessment focused efforts and bridging those to visual, creative, memetic outputs.
      Verificado cracked the code on high impact collaborative journalism for election
      monitoring, and perhaps also serves as a point of hope and optimism against
      the backdrop of a very difficult year for journalism, democracy, and interweb
      idealism.  \n\nSo, with that algorithimically identifiable upnote, on behalf
      of our 2018 team members - Tom, An, Karim, Caio, Noha, Sawy, Alex, Dani, Wafaa,
      Uva, Dima, Abdul Rehman, Nat, Dwight - and our great board - Jon, Hanan, Zeynep,
      Tim, Maria - and the many many partners, volunteers, funders, and fans - thanks
      for helping us keep this crazy dream of an organization going for another year.
      \n\nAbrazos,\nEd"

      The [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/) is Meedan’s community bringing together non-profit organisations and collectives working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies (ICTs), based in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin America (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA). We aim to provide a platform for organizations committed to developing opportunities for those communities facing historic and systemic barriers to entering the fields of media and technology.

      Some of our most impactful partnerships are with women-led organizations using media to promote feminist leadership and rights in emerging economies, but we are also expanding to new areas and new partners - see [our call](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/) for more details, or email us at checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com

      [blogging](https://nawamedia.org/blog/) of project experiences, but also more
      formal academic outputs such as collaborative research papers e.g. one article
      covering the topic of "[Text Similarity Using Word Embeddings to Classify Fake
      News](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339972471_Text_Similarity_Using_Word_Embeddings_to_Classify_Misinformation)"

      in the NAWA region in the aftermath of the 2011 uprisings. We support a number
      of academic projects, postgraduate teaching, and new research collaborations.
      Regular Check Global project impact evaluation is also undertaken here by Birmingham

      a strong reputation and organizes the biennial Stockholm Internet Forum, at
      which Meedan usually plays an organizing role.\n\nIn 2018, the Swedish International
      Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) awarded Meedan with a grant to apply our
      fact-checking and open source investigation tools to a variety of global journalism
      contexts. \n\nMeedan has pioneered award-winning development of tools and techniques
      to support the collaborative curation, analysis and verification of citizen
      media since 2011. With previous SIDA support we’ve provided digital media literacy
      tools and training to over 1500 citizens across Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, and
      Jordan through partnerships with local independent media and universities. In
      collaboration with our project partner, Birmingham City University, we have
      made e-learning materials from these trainings available through the website
      [ArabCitizenMedia.org](https://nawamedia.org/), and through BCU’s Monitoring
      & Evaluation Lab’s online website [impact.bcmcr.org](http://impact.bcmcr.org/).
      \n\nNow, our new and elevated engagement with SIDA takes our work to an entirely
      new level. "

      With a significant grant from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) to expand our work, Meedan’s impact is now scaling up significantly with the launch of CheckGlobal. We’re widening our network beyond our previous focus of the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) to include a number of new global contexts:

      - East Africa (Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania)
      - Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Venezuela)
      - Southeast Asia (Philippines)

      Meedan was established as a 501(c)3 non-profit in March of 2006.

      We didn’t imagine at that time that our journey down the path of building open source tools for journalists and translators in the Middle East would lead us to a front row seat to the 2011 Arab uprisings. And, we didn’t imagine that the software for verification and fact-checking we began coding in 2011 in response to that experience would five years later collide with monitoring the US Presidential election and a global preoccupation with determining truth and credibility.

      Ten years into Meedan we have found ourselves for a second time in the organization five years ahead of history.

      In 2016 we continued our work on Check, our open source tool for verifying and fact checking citizen media, with our engineering team doing a full rewrite of the Check application based on a full redesign delivered by our product team working closely with partners. In August, 94 days before the US election, Google News Lab invited us to a meeting to discuss a plan to customize Check to serve as the backend for a nationwide, ProPublica-led effort to crowdsource coverage of fraud and voter intimidation for those elections. First Draft coordinated the efforts of more than 600 journalism school students, Dig Deeper developed workflows and plans for the physical newsroom, and ProPublica managed 24 hours of complete madness as hundreds of local media partners and several national partners including Gannet, NYTimes and PBS pieced together a picture from thousands of reports from social media, sms messages, and voter protection reports. In the end 1200 reports were checked by this effort, generating 300 stories from our media partners. It was a once in a lifetime project for our team - six members of which spent the election working with 120 journalists, students, and techies from Electionland HQ at the City University of New York.

      2016 was, of course, also a year of many many other great projects at Meedan. An Xiao Mina and Abir Kopty led an amazing research and prototyping project using our translation tool with Mercy Corps for realtime translation needs for displaced populations in the Mediterranean. Dima Saber and her amazing team at the M&E Labs at Birmingham City University led research, training and evaluation for Check, including inspired work with young journalists at Lebanese University. Nora Younis and her team at Al Manassa continued an inspired effort to reinvent collaborative citizen involved journalism. Our work with Amnesty International and the Berkeley Law School Human Rights Center brought verification training to young law school students and digital humanitarians on four continents. And, Bellingcat and the Syrian Archive team they partnered with continued their work to take our tools along as they arguably are inventing new forms of networked investigative journalism. And, Kim Bui and six top US Journalism Schools used Check to track the rise of hate crimes in the wake of the 2016 election, on Documenting Hate.

      All this from a team of 15 spread across 10 time zones working from six countries.

      Our tenth year was, in a nod to the base-ten, a very good year to be Meedan.

      Thanks to all our supporters, partners, and users for making it so.

      Peace x10,
      Ed Bice

      These pressures represent an existential threat to all projects like Meedan that are premised on connecting cross-cultural communities. Against this we can only raise good intentions, do creative work, and continue an organizational culture that forwards friendly optimism in spite of the hostility, cynicism, and bureaucracy that prevails.

      Working during challenging times and across ten time zones this means that team meetings are not optional; they are critical to maintaining the organization. In 2015 we gathered our team members and some of our Checkdesk partners in a small town in the mountains of Italy’s Marche region, Coldigioco. Coldigioco alternately translates as the ‘hill of play (gioco)’ or the ‘hill of the yoke (guoco-slang).’ Trying to have a good time building tools in service of web based collaborations we could find no two better metaphors. Our Checkdesk is, like the yoke, a tool that we hope can bring together several oxen — well, in our case, journalists — to do the work of tilling the rocky and treacherous soil of the social web. Building an internal culture where our work — designing, coding, reporting, training, writing, translating, writing — is confused with play is an ongoing aspiration. But, put forward in this public, annual report, you have me on the record wanting to encourage a sense of creativity, of play, for this team of people working on some of the most challenging problems our world faces at a moment in history when human suffering in the Middle East and the subsequent life endangering migrations are at levels unseen since WWII. So the abiding hope is that regardless the M&E reports, regardless the elusive bugs, that we come to our work to build digital bridges as if we are on the Col di Gioco.

      I am certain that the next years will see social media journalism continue to evolve as social moves to real time and blurry camera phones move to hi def streaming video. In all the stops along the way we will still be needing to solve for the fundamental challenge of bringing meaning and context behind the good actors and the bad actors alike. Meedan has, I often say, staked out a set of some of the most challenging and most important digital challenges in the world. The underlying premise is that if we can build the tools with our users, and if we can train with some of the best journalists in the world that the long arc of the internet will bend toward deeper context and truer tellings and that the world will begin to improve the way it understands itself. Through this lens perhaps the next stage of globalization will be seen as an opening to the creative collaborations and discoveries this planet so needs. In spite of the evidence to the contrary we will try to continue our organizational tilting at the windmills, at play.

      Salam,
      Ed Bice

      We were honored with a [2014 Knight News Challenge award](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/knight-prototype-fund-winner-checkdesk-wants-take-online-verification-next-level) for Checkdesk and were honored to present our work at the [MIT MediaLab Civic Media conference](http://meedan.org/2014/06/checkdesk-announced-knight-news-challenge-winner).

      Meedan’s greatest successes in 2014, though, may have been in the strength and diversity of the open journalism trainings and online educational resources produced under the Checkdesk project. Our Arabic language journalism training resources, available at [arabcitizenmedia.org](http://arabcitizenmedia.org/), produced in collaboration with our partners and led by the outstanding research team at Birmingham City University working under Dr. Dima Saber, represent the best open resources for young and aspiring Arab digital journalists. This work also includes the official Arabic translation of the European Journalism Center’s [Verification Handbook](http://verificationhandbook.com/). By the numbers there have been 1440 journalists trained in media verification and open journalism tools and processes under the Checkdesk project over the past 24 months, these trainings have occurred across the region from rural Egypt to Beirut. Additionally we implemented the first J-School curriculum on media verification in the region with the Lebanese American University.

      2014 also saw Meedan take its first serious foray into social entrepreneurism. With much of our income in 2013 coming in software development, in 2014 Meedan.org spun off a for-profit entity, taking an equity position and, with the help of the non profit law firm Adler Colvin, crafting a resource sharing agreement with Meedan Labs. We are pleased to be bringing social translation technologies to one of the world’s largest networks through Labs. We view this as a wise path for building a sustainable Meedan, having web-wide impact, and diversifying our revenue streams.

      We are grateful to all our sponsors, partners, and friends around the world for the opportunity to do high impact work with a creative and global team and take the continued struggles of our planet and our Internet as reason to carry on with the work.

      Salam,
      Ed Bice

    content: Meedan builds web and mobile tools and implements creative projects for
      journalists and translators. Like our namesake the Arabic town square, our tools
      serve as a gathering place for talented people working to add context to the
      social web. Our approach is to design and implement human-centered, creative,
      and ambitious projects with world-class partners, including, corporations, media
      companies, universities, and researchers. Through all these projects we explore
      and support research, curriculum development, and new forms of digital storytelling.
      Our vision is a world that is better able to see, understand, and value its
      diversity. This, we hope, will lead to the real promise of a digitally networked
      planet, a global conversation that is wider, deeper, and more effective.

    content: "As a context company, I will make an effort to also situate this note
      in the data that describes the current global pandemic. This annual CEO letter
      is being written on a day when the World Health Organization notes 1,279,722
      confirmed global cases of COVID-19. The year began with concern for Wuhan and
      China, but by the start of March there was more attention on other East Asian
      countries. By the end of March, of course, more focus on Iran, Europe, and the
      US. We are currently bracing ourselves for the focus to unfortunately move to
      countries in the greater Global South, including the North Africa Western Asia
      region, Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, where social distancing is much
      harder, and where COVID-19 is likely to have unprecedented devastating effects.
      \n\nToday as I write this note, we have made public an ambitious COVID-19 response
      database and toolkit effort with the support of Sida, Google, Facebook, Omidyar,
      and a cast of global public health experts. I am reminded of a similar point
      in the early weeks of 2011 when our team efforts were in the course of a few
      short days converted to working with a community of hundreds of translators
      to share personal narratives from inside the Egyptian revolution. \n\nJust as
      our work to establish and staff a team of journalists and engineers in Cairo
      from 2007 placed us in a unique position do important work during the Arab Spring,
      our work on Covid-19 response began in 2018 when we established Meedan’s Digital
      Health Lab as a research and practice hub for developing a standard of care
      for responding to misinfodemics. Which is perhaps a thread I can follow here
      to get back to the task of reporting on Meedan’s remarkable year in 2019.\n\nWe
      have always viewed our work as fundamentally global, from our beginnings in
      2006 building a social network for translating and annotating global media to
      our work since 2011 on media verification and fact-checking workflow, we have
      always emphasized the need to work across boundaries and between communities.
      In 2019 we formalized this community aspect of our work, launching the Check
      Global Network with LatAm, APAC, NAWA (North Africa West Asia), and East African
      partners. A few of the highlights from this network: \n\nWe supported the inspiring
      women’s media collective Chicas Poderosas to lead three Mediathons in 2019,
      in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, attended by 300 women journalists. Mediathons
      are two-day events where journalists, communicators, designers, and other women
      who work in media gather with the aim of creating collaborative, multimedia,
      journalistic projects to make visible under-represented issues. \n\nThe NAWA
      Investigative Fund is an initiative of Check Global to financially support new,
      quality investigative journalism from, for, and about the Arab region. The NAWA-IF
      supports a new generation of digital investigative journalists in the North
      Africa and West Asia (NAWA) region by providing micro-grants for investigative
      work across all media.\n\nDuring 2019, our partner Mnemonic has published four
      full-length open source investigations in Syria. The investigations included
      the bombing of civilian infrastructure such as medical facilities, as well as
      the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria and the export of these
      chemicals from the EU to Syria after sanctions.\n\nOur work with Hacks/Hackers
      on the Credibility Coalition continued in 2019, with the release of the CredCat
      as a compendium of misinformation response efforts around the world. \n\nOur
      election monitoring work continued with important efforts in APAC. We ran a
      Pop-Up Newsroom (our partnership with Fathm) with WhatsApp and the civic media
      studio Proto. The Checkpoint project team monitored and responded to visual
      misinformation circulating on WhatsApp through the run up to the Indian national
      election in July. In parallel we ran election monitoring projects in Indonesia,
      Cekfakta, with partner Tempo.co, and in the Philippines, Tsek.ph, with partner
      Vera Files. \n\nCheckpoint was also the first release of our open source solution
      for monitoring and responding to misinformation on WhatsApp. This technology
      is a version of Check that is integrated with WhatsApp (and a dozen other closed
      messaging apps) and optimized for efficiently sorting thousands of incoming
      messages and generating visual cards for viral response. We’ve been extremely
      fortunate to have WhatsApp as a partner in this work to design and develop tools
      to address the most daunting aspect of the global misinformation challenge -
      misinformation response in E2E encrypted messaging networks.  \n\nLooking back,
      it is clear that our accomplishments in 2019 have positioned us well to contribute
      to the unfolding crisis of Covid-19. From this vantage point it is pretty clear
      that now, more than ever, the world needs Meedan to succeed in its mission to
      improve the equity, diversity, and inclusion in our digital ecologies as a means
      to create and extend a healthier world. As a small but mighty organization we
      will continue to build global infrastructure in code, data, partners, and research
      to address the grand challenges that feel so close and pressing.  \n\nPlease
      be safe and stay healthy. \n\nYours, \nEd\nWoodacre, CA"
