    In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

    Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

    ## Check in India

    In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

    ![A snapshot of Check in action in India](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7ByjlM8ANw0DQKaFgilv7k/75663509b60dee23c990ceea2696068a/check-in-india.png)

    In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

    The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

    In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months.

    ## Check in Indonesia

    In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

    Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

    > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

    ## Check in the Philippines

    The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

    The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
    “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

    In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

  body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
    misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
    content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
    since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
    published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election, to
    the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
    before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
    (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
    the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
    credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
    an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of it
    are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how to
    communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for content
    credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
    to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
    of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an initiative
    with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community group (CredWeb).
    [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
    (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
    to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
    documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
    to this issue.\n\n#### [Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment
    on the Web](https://credweb.org/report/20181011)\n\nThis is a vision document
    that captures a general technical approach for improving credibility assessment
    online. It captures everything from terminology to threat models and stakeholders,
    and it lays out some of our core vision for the potential of these standards.
    It’s a hefty lift, and we recommend taking some time to look through it and offer
    commentary.\n\nHere’s how it starts:\n\n*Can you tell, when looking at a random
    web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search
    results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are
    scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed
    and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda or outright lies?
    Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making
    some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods with
    your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making
    bad decisions for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous
    consequences?*\n\n*The Credible Web Community Group was formed at W3C, the organization
    which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological approaches
    to this “credibility assessment” problem. It’s not that we think technology can
    solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one,
    but it seems likely that some technology is making matters worse and that certain
    designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches
    to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.*\n\n\n#### [Credibility
    Signals](https://credweb.org/signals/)\n\nAfter reading through the above, it
    helps to dive into specifics. What do signals look like? In this document, we
    have an outline of some draft signals. They range from signals around rhetoric
    — does it show negative or positive valence? — to a typology around clickbait
    and what it means for a title to accurately represent the body content.\n\nHere’s
    how we frame the document:\n\n*This document is intended to support an ecosystem
    of interoperable credibility tools. These software tools, which may be components
    of familiar existing systems, will gather, process, and use relevant data to help
    people more accurately decide what information they can trust online and protect
    themselves from being misled. We expect that an open data-sharing architecture
    will facilitate efficient research and development, as well as an overall system
    which is more visibly trustworthy.*\n\n*The document has three primary audiences:*\n\n-
    *Software developers and computer science researchers wanting to build systems
    which work with credibility data. For them, the document aims to be a precise
    technical specification, stating what they need for their software to interoperate
    with any other software which conforms to this specification.*\n- *People who
    work in journalism and want to review and contribute to this technology sphere,
    to help make sure it is beneficial and practical.*\n- *Non-computer-science researchers,
    interested in helping develop and improve the science behind this work.*\n\nWe’re
    grateful to the many many participants who gave feedback on these documents in
    their early stages, and we’re looking forward to advancing them in our second
    year as a group. If you’re coming to [CredCon](http://www.credcon.org/), be sure
    to join our workshops and chat with CredWeb co-chair Sandro Hawke. Or, learn more
    about joining the group at [credweb.org](http://credweb.org/).\n\n\n\n\n"

    Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

    ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

    We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

    ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

    Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

    ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

    With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

    ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

    The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

    ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

    Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.

    Before I joined Meedan as a software engineer in late 2011, this amazing team had already noticed that new media was ending the scarcity in which mass media journalism functioned. This was having repercussions for both newsgathering and publishing—no longer were audiences solely reliant on foreign reporters to tell the story. This was particularly true of the reporting of the Middle East, where citizen media been used so powerfully in the midst of such colossal social and political change during the Arab Spring. And citizen media should be verified.

    That’s when Meedan started working on this problem — clearly a very difficult nut to crack. It all started with a participatory liveblog with leading Egyptian independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.

    ![The Early Days: Checkdesk 1.0](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1pyqrBpzaGsslnQzRhWQbq/99411e1d90054d975042df1d3243377a/1_vhGxiy0adssnlxAxPYO91Q.png)

    Less than one year after I joined Meedan, around October 2012, the software engineering team (myself included) started working on a second iteration of this platform for collaborative fact-checking, which at that point was called Checkdesk, which we launched in July 2013.

    Checkdesk was a verification desk for the digital newsroom, designed to help curate user-generated content during breaking news and to connect journalists to citizen sources on the ground. We developed it in cooperation with six leading media outlets in the MENA region: Al Masry Al Youm and Welad El Balad Media Services in Egypt, 7iber in Jordan, Nahar Ashabab and Social Media Exchange (SMEX) in Lebanon, Ma’an Network in Palestine, and Al-Ayyam in Syria.

    ![Checkdesk 2.0 in action by Bellingcat](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/5hGviBzBImRaJ9H6kj2QvJ/6f2de5304cc654ba0983ec1a96bab305/1_v1g4OUFLKHmvwSv_ChhYRQ.gif)

    From a technological perspective, Checkdesk was built as a monolithic web application using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), an open source platform for web content management. As a CMS, Drupal was among the most successful and seemed like a great fit for our needs, because it strikes a great balance between getting up and running in no time, and the ability to extend its functionality almost infinitely. It served us quite well between 2013 and early 2016 and during that time we had the opportunity to [make numerous contributions to its community](https://www.drupal.org/node/2343639) and attend some Drupal conferences to share all the expertise we gained with that work.

    As our applications grew, we started facing scalability challenges with Drupal. These challenges manifested in many ways, from code maintainability to lower performance, proliferation of defects and automated testing. It was time for us to rethink our software architecture. We had to implement more features, go mobile, support more languages, handle more content, serve more users and face new social events—mainly elections.

    We accepted a big challenge at that time, which was to completely rewrite Checkdesk, in six months, from scratch, with a completely new code base.

    Personally, I had some good pre-Meedan experience with the open source web application framework [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) since 2009. During my early days at Meedan I had the opportunity to implement a prototype in Ruby On Rails for social media translation, which was called Translatedesk. This prototype evolved into a micro services architecture made of several Ruby On Rails APIs which were at the core of our translation product, [Bridge](https://meedan.com/en/bridge/).

    So we decided to pursue a similar software stack approach as Bridge and re-implemented Checkdesk as a multi-service application: some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs written in Ruby On Rails, a web application using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and, as usual, everything was released [as an open source project](https://github.com/meedan/check). We also started a new culture for our software development process, which includes writing automated tests for everything seeking [100% code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa/code), [continuous testing](http://travis-ci.org/meedan), [code quality with maximum GPA at Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa) and containerization of our softwares.

    Not only the code was rewritten, but also the branding: Checkdesk was brought out from behind the ‘desk.’ The 3.0 version of our open source software was rebranded as, simply, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    ![Checkdesk 3.0, a.k.a. Check](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1Dkor8b2zPH26RZptleGDl/da47acfd15d8a1a4ec964482baa491fb/1_pcz3ZoK-tD_C9gnM2CCpnw.png)

    Check provides a central workbench facilitating online verification newsroom collaboration, allowing participating journalists and editors a simple and powerful framework to work together to investigate and annotate links, media and claims. This new code base has been serving us well since then, and during that time we implemented many improvements, new features and performance enhancements in order to accommodate its increasing usage. Since we first released it in October 2016, it was used by OJA-winning election monitoring projects like [Electionland](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/checking-the-vote-how-check-was-used-during-electionland-4242dd875e4b) (United States, 2016), [CrossCheck](https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.org/france-fr/) (France, 2017) and [Verificado](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/verificado-2018-wins-major-collaboration-and-partnerships-award-e6812ecbbdf) (Mexico, 2018), in addition to similar projects in Asia, namely [Indonesia, Philippines and India](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/meedan-in-asia-how-check-supported-three-simultaneous-election-reporting-initiatives-9b6626e89e3a).

    In India we had a new big challenge to face: misinformation on WhatsApp. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/). In December 2018 we started to integrate Check into the WhatsApp business API and released this feature in early April 2019, just in time for the elections in India. Check Message was born: our tool for fact-checking against disinformation at scale, seeking scalability, reliability and great performance.

    ![Check Message architecture](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4YDeFFaKebhPeh3N1xAt9p/f3f144a5e8ebbd10c083377b3db57b89/1_QEFoJ2yG5LvjfQVew-oPyA.png)

    Our collaboration in India, called [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched in April as the first real use case of Check Message. In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification and our software was useful to group duplicate requests, allow similar items to be related, prioritize most requested items and, in general, optimize the fact-checker’s work as much as possible.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    After this first release, we generalized our software module from WhatsApp-specific to more platform-agnostic, and we now support other closed message platforms, like Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. This module was implemented as a Check bot. Check allows for extensible scripts and functions that help you augment your verification experience with tools like private messenger integration, archiving and language detection. We call these scripts [bots](https://github.com/meedan/check-bots), and they live in the [Bot Garden](https://medium.com/meedan-user-guides/bot-garden-user-guide-adc2c1d743f3). We hope that this bot infrastructure can be used by other developers around the world to integrate Check with other tools and with their own workflows.

    We keep working on Check in order to improve user experience, content ingestion and augmented verification. Stay tuned! What I can say is that I’m really enjoying the things we are working on right now and really excited for the next challenges we’ll face and the new software support we’ll implement in the upcoming years in order to make Check even more global. I invite everyone to join us on that. If you are a software developer interested in open source and in these challenges we’re tackling, get in touch on [GitHub](http://github.com/meedan). If you are journalist and want to use Check for your project, get in touch with us on our [website](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    Ultimately, it’s a collaborative effort.

    Conversations on family WhatsApp groups in India can be exhausting. *“Your bank has gone bust. Its share prices have dropped. Before you lose your life savings, find a reliable bank and transfer all your money.”* My anxious family members shared this message on one of our many family WhatsApp groups.

    The language and style of the message looked dubious to me. A few inquiries and one good fact-check relieved me: My bank was safe! Before I could share the good news on the family group, there was another forward that family members did not want anyone to miss. A big chocolate brand was gifting free chocolate hampers for Diwali! Before I could alert family members to not fall for the new hoax, there was mayhem on the group. The number of chocolate boxes purportedly being gifted increased with each message! So my little alert was buried in an avalanche of chocolate discussion among very excited young and old members of my family.

    Studies have shown that trust in the person sharing a message on closed messaging apps like WhatsApp is a key indicator of the message being shared multiple times. It is because of this trust that even suspicious looking messages are spread. I often talk with friends about this; *“What is the right strategy to call out family members sending fake news on WhatsApp groups?” “I can’t stop being Judge Judy on my family WhatsApp groups and people hate me for that.” “The last time I told my uncle his message was fake, he made a nasty comment and ignored me at the next family gathering.”*

    From first-hand experience running newsrooms, I can tell you that fact-checkers in India face similar concerns to my friends and I. I once met a media marketing manager who managed 60 WhatsApp groups. I wondered how he kept track of important messages. Shortly after that interaction, my newsroom went from print to digital, and I found myself on at least 40 WhatsApp groups that had media persons and other local professionals. The barrage of good morning messages did not stop until early evening. Group members were happy to share all kinds of unsolicited advice about personal or professional issues. Birthdays and anniversaries are big in India, and wishes, memes, songs on these occasions started from midnight and never ended! Amidst all this, fake information filtered into these groups as well. It was nearly impossible to keep track of conversations and information.

    What is the solution to this? Will we just learn to live surrounded by a fog of noise and misinformation?

    *“There’s a lot of noise on WhatsApp. Ignoring it is not an option; this is the pulse of conversations around us today. Addressing it is a challenge because of the clutter.”* My conversations with fact-checkers in India indicate high levels of exhaustion just from monitoring incoming messages on WhatsApp. Many of them work with limited resources and small teams. Managing a helpline on WhatsApp is not easy; from employment related inquiries to requests for setting up appointments with celebrities — fact-checkers have dealt with it all. There’s also video calls from users at all hours, pornographic content, trolls, these are also concerns flagged by fact-checkers in India.

    So how do fact-checking initiatives cope with this? Well…

    - Some have had to discontinue their helplines
    - Others have to scroll through several messages to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones
    - Fact-checkers are also relying on other social media platforms to look for relevant information to address. “We can’t not address misinformation on WhatsApp”, the last fact-checker I met said.

    #### Check is here to help!

    Meedan’s digital tool, Check, has features that can provide solutions to messages on closed apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was introduced to Check last year when I learned about Verificado, a collaborative election reporting and fact-checking project in Mexico. In March this year I was actively using Check while working on Checkpoint, a research project around the 2019 Indian general election where Check integrated with the WhatsApp Business API.

    As a Check journalist, there are many tasks that the tool simplified

    - I didn’t have to look at a WhatsApp number everyday to find relevant election related messages
    - It was possible for me to collaborate with other team members, even those members who were not physically present in the same space, because we all had access to the same feed
    - Finding important messages buried in a heap of junk also became easier because of Check
    - Keeping track of work and looking at patterns of misinformation was another task where different features of Check came in handy.

    I saw the potential of Check to perform many more tasks to help fact-checkers, journalists, activists and researchers. As a team member leading Meedan’s work in the Asia Pacific region, I am now engaging with new partners and introducing Check to their workflows. I understand the concerns of journalists and fact-checkers well, and some of their concerns are now on the roadmap for Meedan’s team to improve Check and enhance its features. As a Meedan team member, I understand how Check can be positioned in the work of organizations and how its existing features can be applied effectively. It’s a dynamic relationship and it’s a good place to be in.

  body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
    of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
    is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a global
    challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training sessions,
    host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and have network
    partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people, crossing borders,
    gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly global collaboration
    to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a global anti(in-person)-gathering.
    In Meedan terms: the future of our global town squares is dependent on our near
    term efforts to keep our physical town squares empty, and our digital town squares
    free of dangerous misinformation. \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19
    pandemic we are addressing the immediate needs of a global team and also working
    to develop programs that contribute to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing
    the lead of some other [inspiring organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
    \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and personal
    paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose school has
    been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members. We have closed
    our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have put a hold on
    the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.   \n\nLast week
    we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support for their health
    and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans, budgets, and project
    timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent and encouragement
    of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development Cooperation Agency.
    \ \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses. Last year we launched
    the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to health information as
    a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and Nat Gyenes framed some
    of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient piece in the Atlantic, [How
    Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
    \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous international
    bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable areas for
    civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with epidemiologists,
    public health communications experts, technology companies, and civil society
    partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository of annotated
    misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of our Check Global,
    Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies into this new program
    area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible threat to our emotional
    and physical well-being, I want to close this brief statement by saying perhaps
    this global project to stay apart might actually serve to bring together a world
    that is riven politically and ideologically. It’s going to take some brilliant
    and heroic collaborations to make it through the next several months and we are
    committed to doing what we can as an organization placed at the epicenter of misinformation
    response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist? Public Health Expert? Talented
    Engineer? [Post-doc Researcher](https://meedan.com/jobs/research-fellow/ \"Meedan
    Job Posting\")? Email us at hello@meedan.com if you want to lend a hand with the
    formidable task of getting high quality COVID-19 info onto the interwebs while
    we rebuild this plane inflight and work through a new way of running a coronavirus
    resistant organization.\n\nEAB<br/>\nMarch 16, 2020<br/>\nWoodacre, CA"

  body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work remotely
    most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity for journalists,
    fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of COVID–19, the novel
    coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences focusing on Internet
    freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check), the
    project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
    from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
    Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in COVID-19-related
    content, and  public health and science communication experts have been helping
    us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to ensure  accurate information
    can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate health information usually
    spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities at risk, but this year it’s more
    critical for us to accomplish what we usually do at conferences. While we are
    disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues in person, there’s an opportunity
    here. There have always been many reasons to have a virtual conference, but now
    there are more people and organizations motivated to do something about it - there
    are entire industries going virtual. At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity
    and inclusion amongst both staff and partners. If we work on this issue during
    a pandemic, we can make conferences more accessible for everyone as a long term
    goal too. Participants from emerging economies often have difficulty getting visas
    to attend conferences. Global climate change has led several people to forgo airplane
    travel. Parents have to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some
    disabilities make travel difficult, and the disability activism community has
    long called for improvements to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote
    participation has been used by several conferences to enable attendance for people
    who cannot travel. While this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual
    conferences are not widespread, and they lack virtual versions of useful conference
    activities. Many of the open source tools we use were designed by covering walls
    in a massive number of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What
    do you need from a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions?
    What works for you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe
    started with the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2.
    Presenting product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5.
    One-on-one discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7.
    Un-conference formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe
    came up with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked
    at were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
    budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
    high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
    indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
    thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
    has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a disability,
    however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is not an option
    at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling. As long
    as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate with other
    participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant lives in a region
    or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection. Any virtual conference
    technology has to take low bandwidth environments into account.\n\n3. This participant
    has a passport or legal status that makes it difficult for them to travel. They
    often get rejected for visas, even when they are a featured speaker at a conference.
    \n\n3. This participant lives in a country that censors the Internet and arrests
    journalists. In order to participate safely, they can only go to conferences with
    a no photo or video policy, whether this is a blanket ban or attendee preferences
    can be signaled by the color of their conference lanyard. Any virtual conference
    technology must allow private access, allowances for pseudonyms, participation
    without voice or video, and possibly compatibility with censorship circumvention
    technologies.\n\n4. This participant is Deaf. Their technology needs may include
    live captioning, participation by typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video
    of presenters to enable lip reading, or clear audio from participants depending
    on their level of hearing and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant
    is blind. Virtual conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers,
    and presenters should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of
    their presentation materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems
    understanding one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation,
    or just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
    participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the presentation.
    They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the ability to ask questions
    of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who need mobility aids face obstacles
    when traveling. Wheelchair users often get broken chairs back from airlines. When
    these chairs are custom fit, there are no temporary replacements that can make
    participating in a conference a pain-free experience. Power wheelchairs are very
    expensive, so travel can mean gambling with one’s mobility for a long time after
    a conference. \n\n9. This participant has modest tech skills and may need help
    with operating the interface for online meetings. Usability is an access issue.
    \n\nWe’re working with our communities to make lasting change out of this emergency
    situation. The civic tech community is evaluating software and practices for conferences
    and hackathons. We’re also expanding our online developer community. Let’s build
    something together! \n\nEmail us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>
    to get started. "

  body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
    of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
    ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
    to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso, and
    Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with newsrooms,
    fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three continents.\n\nThis
    represents significant growth from previous years, allowing us to deepen our support
    for these regions with program leads who are deeply familiar with their local
    contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our amazing partners around the
    world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional leads, along with Wafaa Heikal,
    our long-running program manager who is now heading up our efforts in Africa and
    the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi
    is passionate about feminism and local journalism. Over the last two decades,
    her work has brought the two together. Shalini has studied misinformation, particularly
    on closed messaging platforms. She has been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International
    Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/) ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)).
    The fellowship focused on designing creative ways to counter misinformation. As
    a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/), ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini
    led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/) - a research project focused
    on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini started her professional
    journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/), a centre for gender education.
    She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented communities to come
    into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes. Shalini is
    the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (“News Waves”
    in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya is known
    for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women from some
    of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project is a testament
    to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent media is essential,
    as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini believes that
    [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can be a turning point
    for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation shared on closed messaging
    platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate, annotate, verify and archive
    misinformation and Shalini believes that for several small and independent newsrooms,
    this is a great service that no other platform currently provides. Check has tremendous
    potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers to design collaborative projects, especially
    around areas of common interest. Its unique features are great for large projects
    on politics, health, climate change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n###
    Meet Isabella Barroso in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa,
    is Meedan's Latin America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms
    in both Spanish and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's
    program team with a passion for human-centred design and product development that
    is fit to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design,
    Isa hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills
    in product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
    journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
    [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
    and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am now
    developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\" noted
    Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned a lot
    about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this happens
    with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America seems to
    be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging on
    closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
    overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
    Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in journalism.
    She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy to literature.
    \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with culture and social
    media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first job was as a culture
    journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
    due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
    came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
    of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
    I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
    open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
    the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
    media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
    with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news cycle.
    In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor and
    verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human rights
    researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
    annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
    open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support different
    workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate and what
    context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work across an
    interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with small teams
    and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring projects, understanding
    the particular national context and partner capacities and then designing new
    workflows around them.”\n\n"

  body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives is
    one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
    with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
    and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
    expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
    information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
    health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
    fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and time
    at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This ensures
    that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time. Including
    specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization hosts
    daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries may
    change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the exact
    point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2. Be
    context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
    For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
    about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
    to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only. This
    ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
    and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular treatments
    have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information you
    use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information you
    have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed to
    publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
    such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
    This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
    information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
    with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
    a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
    to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
    our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
    health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
    is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
    and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
    a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
    for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
    Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical recommendations
    to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with that. If there
    are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants answered, they
    can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:  \n\n>   “If you're
    looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare provider, and   be sure
    to review the World Health Organization website for more information about COVID-19:
    https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs the COVID-19
    pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents and screens, drastically
    impacting public health, our way of life and global markets, Meedan is also reflecting
    on this historic moment and its emerging lessons: In the coming weeks we will
    be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19, written by journalists, fact-checkers,
    censorship experts, thought leaders and academics. The contributors are writing
    about the pandemic through the fog of the war— filing reports and analyses as
    news is still breaking, long before we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe
    analyses will aim to shine a light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship,
    localization of information access, and public trust, as we start to think about
    moving forward and away from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this
    in our newsletter and on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against
    viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore,
    antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However,
    if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because
    bacterial co-infection is possible\"\n\n"

  body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
    massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
    Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
    support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
    researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
    a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
    and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
    infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material for
    journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize pandemic-related
    information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can present a bottleneck
    for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies, when demand
    for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the Harvard School
    of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have been researching
    how health information inequity and digital health misinformation can impact the
    spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps that can exacerbate
    those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
    on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care. \n\nIt
    is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic, that
    two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
    and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
    health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research and
    epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious disease
    researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively to a
    wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
    is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
    CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
    and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
    — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the second
    challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is supplying
    important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan to utilize
    ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate can be shared
    readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database into fact-checking
    bot workflows that many of our partners are already using to source questions
    from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to either access existing
    resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries to be fact-checked.
    This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations directly, and
    providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable initiatives
    being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health ministries
    around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality information
    through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative, Twitter,
    Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency and the
    Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered around
    six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access to experts
    can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities to access
    reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is populated and
    regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly sourced questions
    and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental health
    organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs during
    the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global network
    of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain the
    database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers and
    communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
    COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
    public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
    required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue to
    collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies and
    evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact assessment,
    monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design. In addition
    to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate to be working
    with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City University, as
    well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the behavioral impact
    of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database priorities and
    content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist COVID-19 response
    effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative  to bridge research
    and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators. We are developing
    templates for packaged, verified content that can be included in outputs sent
    from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded in behavior science
    and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of care for communications,
    and include best practices for addressing health information response challenges,
    such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and transparency in the ever-changing
    information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__ We are prioritizing pathways
    for disseminating contents of the database across languages to fact-checkers and
    pandemic communicators around the world. We are also integrating into Meedan’s
    open source verification and fact-checking workspace software, Check, in order
    to make its expert-reviewed contents available to the public. Through Check, we
    are creating an interface for users to design custom multilingual bots for disseminating
    their fact-checked content, connecting users to closed messaging networks including
    Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then
    be able to access a subset of relevant resources, selected by each fact-checking
    organization individually, via a simple query system, and will be presented with
    short lists of up-to-date content that matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__
    Through this project, we are examining the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions
    across languages and geographies, exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation,
    and translating findings into useful insights for public health communicators.
    In addition, as a group that works closely with partners in emerging economies,
    Meedan is closely following the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people
    living in densely populated urban areas and underserved communities that don't
    have access to public health care systems. Our team members in different regions
    are tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence
    against women, and insights will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning
    each day, information and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading
    in online ecosystems as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world.
    During this historic time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical
    questions about everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious
    disease research. Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer
    questions about complex health information, medical research and epidemiological
    findings, while public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers
    struggle to urgently communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The
    result of this problem set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor
    health outcomes, as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world
    spread of disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure
    on fact-checking organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience
    to health experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including
    research on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and
    the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
    Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped much
    of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of Meedan’s
    Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal of promoting
    health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six years, these
    ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night dinners and graduate
    school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu brainstorming, in
    sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival, the Digital Health
    @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News Initiative Summits,
    in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics, mixed methods, and human
    rights lectures, and in conversations between friends and colleagues, hopeful
    in our ability to create something important together. I am immensely grateful
    to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make the most of our work together,
    and to all of our supporters as we further develop this intersection.\n\nThis
    COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without the partnership and collaboration
    of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural Insights Team, Birmingham City
    University, students and researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health
    and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and our network of public health
    specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this initiative, we are keen to learn
    and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the challenging
    and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators are doing to address this
    pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please reach out at health@meedan.com
    to talk more.\n"

    وأزمةً صحيةً عالميةً، قد ازدادت المعلومات الصحية المُضللة والشائعات عبر منصات
    التواصل الاجتماعي، ممَّا أدى إلى تقويض الجهود المبذولة لنشر معلومات موثوقة وتم
    التحقق منها حول الفيروس. وينطوي هذا الأمر على تحدٍ خاص لمنظمات المجتمع المدني
    و التعاونيات والمجموعات الناشطة في مجال التكنولوجيا والتحقق من المعلومات التي
    تكافح من أجل فهم هذه الجائحة والتصدي لآثارها في سياقاتها المحلية. \n\nتطلق ميدان
    منح \"تشك جلوبال\" الصغيرة في محاولة منها لدعم الإعلاميين المستقلين ومدققي الحقائق
    والمواطنين الصحفيين والناشطين والعاملين في حقل التكنولوجيا والمعرفة الرقمية والتحقق
    من الأخبار في جهودهم الرامية إلى تغطية تفشي فيروس كوفيد-19 ، وتستهدف هذه المنح
    تحديداً المجموعات الناشطة في شمال أفريقيا وغرب آسيا، وأفريقيا، وأمريكا اللاتينية
    ومنطقة آسيا التي تطل على المحيط الهادئ.  \n\nوتهدف هذه المنح إلى دعم مشاريع تدقيق
    الحقائق والتحقق من الأخبار والمعلومات ومبادرات المراقبة المحلية وتوثيق يوميات
    الواقع المحلي  للمجتمعات الخاضعة للحجر الصحي وحملات التربية الإعلامية والرقمية
    وتعقب أثر منع التجول على الأنظمة الديمقراطية، وفحص تأثير الجائحة على آليات المراقبة
    التقنية، ورأسمالية المراقبة والحقوق المدنية والعنف ضد المرأة فيما يتعلق بفيروس
    كوفيد-19. وبالتالي، فإننا نشجع المتقدمين على الإبداع في مقترحاتهم. وإننا حريصون
    على دعم إنتاج أنواع مختلفة من المشروعات بما فيها البودكاست (البث الصوتي الرقمي)
    والفيديوهات والوثائقيات والمؤلفات والحملات ومجموعات الأدوات والأرشيفات الرقمية
    والتدوين. كما نتطلع إلى دعم المقترحات التي لا تركز فقط على تغطية المعلومات المضللة
    حول الجائحة، بل أيضاً النظر في حياة الناس وتجاربهم أثناء الحجر الصحي.\n\nنحن حالياً
    نقبل مقترحات بالعربية والإنجليزية والفرنسية والإسبانية والبرتغالية. وسيتم النظر
    في الطلبات بشكل دوري. . \n\n\n- يُمكن للأفراد التقدم بطلب حتى 500 دولار. \n- يُمكن
    للمنظمات التقدم بطلب حتى 2000 دولار.\n- يُمكن للمشاريع الجماعية التقدم بطلب حتى
    2500 دولار. \n\n\n### عملية تقديم الطلبات\n\n\n- ينبغي على المتقدمين ملء [[نموذجاً

    \ تجتمع اللجنة الاستشارية للصندوق كل أسبوع لمراجعة جميع الطلبات\n- سيتم إخطار
    المتقدمين الناجحين خلال فترة من 5 إلى 10 أيام من تاريخ تقديم الطلب\n\n\n\n###
    معايير الاختيار\n- __الأصالة ودرجة الأهمية__: جودة الطلب المكتوب. ما التحديات
    التي يقترح معالجتها؟ ما منطقته الجغرافية/تركيزه الجغرافي؟\n- __قابلية التحقيق__:
    هل سيكون المتقدم قادراً على الإيفاء بوعوده المذكورة في الطلب؟ هل خطة العمل واقعية
    في الإطار الزمني المُقترح؟ هل يُمثِّل العمل الميداني أي قضايا متعلقة بالأخلاق
    والصحة والسلامة لا بد من وضعها في عين الاعتبار؟  \n- __الأثر والتعميم__: هل يحدد
    الطلب جمهوراً معنياً بالعمل؟ كيفية تخطيط العمل لتغيير التصور بشأن كوفيد-19؟ هل
    الطلب واضح من حيث سبب أهمية هذا العمل الآن؟ سيتم إعطاء الأولوية للمشاريع التي
    تخدم المجتمعات المحلية والمجتمعات المحرومة والنساء والمجموعات ثنائية الجندر و
    الأقليات، وسكان الأقاليم .\n- __الدقة__: هل ستلتزم بمنهجية تدقيق الحقائق؟ كيف
    سيتحقق المتقدم من دقة مصادره؟ هل المصادر المستخدمة في حملة التربية الإعلامية الخاصة
    بك تعد موثوقة؟\n\nالرجاء ملاحظة أنه إذا لم تتلق منا رداً خلال ثلاثة أسابيع من
    تاريخ تقديم طلبك، فهذا يعني أن طلبك غير موَّفق. ويؤسفنا القول بأنه لا يُمكننا
    على الرد على كل طلب غير موَّفق بسبب كمية الطلبات الكبيرة التي نتلقاها.  \n\nسيقوم
    المتقدمين المقبولين بنشر مشاريعهم على منصاتهم الخاصة وسيشار إليها أيضاً في صفحة

  body: "Meedan is excited to announce a new wave of recruitment for the Check Global
    Network. This is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
    working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin America
    (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA). \n\nWe aim to provide
    a platform that strengthens and facilitates the work of organizations committed
    to promoting the development of people that have faced historic and systemic barriers
    in entering the fields of media and technology.\n\nOur most impactful partnerships
    are currently with women-led organizations and feminist networks using media to
    promote feminist leadership and rights in emerging economies of the Global South.
    The Check Global Network is now expanding to new areas and new partners. As part
    of this phase of expansion, we are actively seeking partnerships with groups that
    embed feminist values and concepts of social justice into organizational practices.
    \n\nThe Check Global Network is a community for sharing, learning and reflection.
    The network activities will be led by Meedan. In this process we will draw upon
    skills of Meedan team members, the network members themselves as well as those
    of other partners and institutions that we have worked with in different regions
    over the last decade. \n\nThe main activities of the network will focus on capacity
    building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational development,
    providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be part of a growing
    impactful community. \n\n__Forums for engagement__: \n- We’ll invite Check Global
    Network members to participate in virtual and in person learning events that we
    organise. \n- We will recommend members for conferences, fellowships, internships,
    training programs and other structured learning opportunities.\n- Meedan’s weekly
    newsletter, [The Checklist](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=8fa4ab9399),
    will feature the work of network members and will provide them regular updates
    on misinformation. \n- Meedan will design collaborative and time-bound projects
    that meet the needs of network members and provide opportunities to respond to
    global issues. \n\n__To join the network, please write to us at <a href=\"mailto:checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com\">checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com</a>

  body: "The [2020 Global Misinfodemic Report](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/)
    examines the impact of COVID-19 outside of the Global North.\n\n<p class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a
    class=\"button no-margin\" href=\"https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/\">Read
    the report</a>\n</p>\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the [2020 Global Misinfodemic
    Report](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/),
    a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information scholars, legal
    experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining the impacts of COVID-19
    misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Brazil and other
    regions. Working with scholars, verification experts and journalists from major
    academic institutions, broadcasting stations and fact-checking organizations,
    the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation into the way this unprecedented
    viral event is both reforming and confirming the state of our global information
    ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, as countries worked to contain the
    first signs of the physical virus spreading, a secondary crisis occured: misinformation
    on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
    [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
    and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
    \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
    UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
    and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health advice
    and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the airwaves.
    Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going viral, stigmatizing
    and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against this disease, too.”\n\nA
    misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
    and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
    leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
    interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
    approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report touches
    on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are spreading
    online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating with certain
    communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation on  public
    health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging economies?\n-
    What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe first
    wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed world,
    but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New York Times
    editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies ahead is the
    spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict, through packed
    refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh, through
    teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social distancing
    is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without the fiscal
    capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would be disastrous
    not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies of raw materials
    are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger and the virus
    doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely to ensue, long
    after countries in North America and Europe control their initial outbreaks, is
    sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about the pandemic.
    In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our partners’ fact-checking
    tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched COVID-19 misinformation
    evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments involving tea, vitamins,
    hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation about penalties for
    spreading misinformation or just spreading information, about the pandemic \n-
    Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this misinformation can trigger
    real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing the most obvious and
    harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where [people are dying
    from drinking Methanol after false and misleading information circulated on social
    media about its use as a treatment](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/nearly-500-people-dead-in-iran-after-drinking-methanol-to-fight-off-covid-19-1.4870674).
    In other regions, the misinfodemic materializes as public trust in leadership
    weans and citizens look to sometimes misguided informal leaders for answers to
    complex scientific information. \n\nAs both the physical and online virus rages
    on into the summer, the Global Misinfodemic Report will begin publishing groups
    of articles from contributors around the world. [See the most recent reports](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/)

  body: "We were thrilled to hear that the focus of Tech & Check this year would be
    on projects matching speakers’ claims with previously published fact-checks and
    other related text and image matching efforts in service of fact-checking. Just
    as we didn’t anticipate that our main technical focus would be the subject of
    this year’s gathering, we didn’t suspect that our respective planned travel from
    the UK and Brazil for this year’s Tech & Check would be replaced with an opening
    night mixer via Zoom due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 crisis around
    the world. Regardless of the global pandemic, on April 3rd, journalists, engineers,
    computer scientists and other professionals met virtually to watch a few demos
    and discuss claim matching in the context of fact-checking.\n\nLast year at [Tech
    & Check](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/tech-check-cooperative-2019/), we presented
    [Check Message](https://meedan.com/check), an integration between Check (Meedan’s
    open source platform for collaborative fact-checking) and the [WhatsApp Business
    API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api), as a tool to deal with misinformation
    in closed message applications at scale. Just a few days after our presentation,
    the technology went live with [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), an
    effort to monitor, verify, and conduct research on WhatsApp misinformation during
    the 2019 Indian Election led by Delhi-based media research and training organization
    [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/) and commissioned and technically assisted by WhatsApp.
    Check Message allows media partners to operate tip lines to which people can forward
    possibly misleading, miscontextualised, or false information they see to the partner
    for fact-checking. During the Indian Elections, PROTO received over 100,000 submissions
    from the public.\n\n![Caio Almeida presenting at Tech & Check 2019 in Duke University.

    Huth.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4B2OKx6sL10bVZHj87I38t/8d09acce21eec3d68322d26242b64dd7/Tech___Check_2019.jpg)\n<p

    & Check 2019</a> in Duke University. Image via the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media
    and Democracy, and photo by Colin Huth.</p>\n\n\nMany of those submissions were
    similar to other submissions, but at that time we just had the technology implemented
    to match identical submissions—text or images—so, many submissions that were similar
    but not identical had to be manually marked as such, which was uselessly costly.
    In order to optimize that process, we started to work on tools that could suggest
    similar items automatically to our users.\n \nWe were honored to be one of five
    organizations that demonstrated their work in this area. In our case, we demonstrated
    our current claim and image matching tools for fact-checkers, which integrate
    with our open-source software, Check. We developed an [open-source architecture](https://github.com/meedan/alegre)
    to use ElasticSearch to efficiently search language volumes of text items by their
    vector representations in near real-time and integrated this into Check. For Checkpoint,
    we used pre trained word vectors, but the architecture we developed is not specific
    to these choices and can easily be adapted to other vector-representation models
    and languages. We are now using the [Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04307),
    and are working to develop additional approaches to support even more of many
    languages our partners across the world use. For images, we are using perceptual
    hashing and evaluating newer approaches including [PDQ](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/master/hashing/pdq).\n
    \n![Architectural diagram of Check’s open source claim similarity framework](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/gOQBQqGPrtCPCbFHRm1Wy/710c99128eb87060be2846b0af5a8718/check-similarity-bot.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Architectural diagram of Check’s <a href=\"https://github.com/meedan/check\">open
    source</a> claim similarity framework</p>\n\n \nFor both images and text, Check
    users are able to define a set of similarity rules, which can relate items to
    be verified based on how similar they are. The user defines that minimum similarity
    threshold, which is a number between 0% and 100%, and if our image and text matching
    tool returns a similarity value equal or higher than that threshold, two items
    are related automatically. The idea is that we are able to optimize the fact-checking
    process by group similar items together rather than working on them separately.
    This also helps our partners better understand what content is most submitted
    to their tip lines. The video below demonstrates those features.\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe
    class=\"youtube\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTbTQGhPpu0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"
    allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Video-demonstration
    of Check similarity tools, presented at Tech & Check 2020</p>\n\n\nThis was part
    of the discussion that followed the demos. In the afternoon, people interested
    and working on claim matching discussed the problem types we have ahead of us,
    and came up with three main branches: \n \nThe first one was obviously __claim
    matching and semantic text similarity__: the matching of a novel claim with previously
    checked claims to determine if there is a substantially similar previous claim.
    Potential solutions that were proposed include, for example, named entity overlap,
    vector representations, comparing with knowledge bases; categorization of previously
    made claims and comparison to a novel claim; and combinations of multiple approaches.
    \n \nThe second problem type was __human matching__. Pure computational fact checking
    is prone to mismatches, sometimes funny, sometimes truly detrimental. Where and
    how can human editors, crowdsourcing and other forms of human intervention be
    used to assist and mediate this system? One proposal for that is to have an editor
    as a final step in an otherwise computational pipeline. At Meedan, we’re trying
    to develop efficient human-in-the-loop approaches where we can finetune and improve
    our computational tools based on the standard actions users take while using Check.
    Every time users remove an automated match or add a manually match we gain valuable
    insights into the types of things that should and shouldn’t match. Over time,
    we want to use this data to evaluate new approaches and improve the existing approaches.
    In other words, we see the system more as a circle than a pipeline: our algorithms
    make suggestions and learn from users’ actions. \n \nThe third problem type we
    discussed was __image matching__, and we discussed solutions like different image
    hashing algorithms, object retrieval, object identification and information extraction
    from images.\n \nWe are excited to keep working on those problems and to contribute
    with the Tech & Check community, and we can’t wait to share more interesting insights
    and findings next year at Tech & Check."

  body: "The bot, which also works on other social messaging platforms, is designed
    to scale response through the COVID crisis and other topical content.\n\nMeedan
    is pleased to roll out Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
    and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
    Twitter DM, and more. Now being tested in Brazil, India and across Africa with
    COVID-19 content, our bot is an extension of [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
    our collaborative platform for digital media verification and annotation, to boost
    the work of human journalists through AI-powered claims matching, smart menus,
    and the ability to source new content directly from users for fact-checking.\n\nIt
    has the following key features:\n\n- A fully customizable interaction scenario
    , allowing fact-checking teams to spin up interactive menus of frequently-requested
    content to react to events rapidly  \n- Enables audience-submitted tips for queries
    not answered by the bot\n- Ties directly to a team’s Check database, allowing
    them to send previously fact-checked reports\n\nFor our partner organizations,
    the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, size the
    demand for specific topics, and distribute key information in close messaging
    networks. Through building this relations, it is also the  opportunity to develop
    interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end-users to assess behavioural
    impacts of fact-checks.\n\n![phone bot](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/417goq4WmR29NxllRAvdDX/11677981cda6d5de9658ddfc6dc2dc9b/phone_bot.gif)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
    and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
    Twitter DM, and more.</p>\n\nWhen designing this bot, we worked with our fact-checking
    partners to ensure the following principles were met:\n\n- __Audience development:__
    Fact-checking teams have spent years cultivating trust with their audiences, and
    we wanted to make sure the bot supports this work. Teams can customize every interaction
    and content  that represents their unique voice. They can  continue to receive
    fact-check requests through the same tipline and communicate with their audiences
    directly.\n- __Ready for scale:__ We are testing the bot with teams that receive
    thousands of messages per week. The bot is designed to handle requests of many
    thousands more, automating frequently-requested content while overall improving
    the quality of tipline content submissions.\n- __Local content, local languages:__
    This bot can provide more detailed content coverage for local audiences that complements
    the work of global health organizations and national health ministries. Fact-checking
    organizations can create custom resource responses for their end users that are
    context or language-specific, directly meeting a target population’s health information
    needs. Thanks to our partnership with the [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/),
    we can also localize the content and interface to relevant languages.\n\nRight
    now, we’re testing this bot with COVID-19 content and localized COVID-19 resources.
    Per our ongoing commitments to open source and the [Open COVID Pledge](https://meedan.com/blog/meedan-supports-the-open-covid-pledge/),
    it is also [open source](https://github.com/meedan/check). The goal is to link
    this up with [Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/),
    developed by our [Digital Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/). This database
    contains contextualized health information developed and vetted by public health
    experts that can be used as source material in fact-checks, removing some of the
    challenges of accessing verified expert content  \n\nThe bot can be fully adapted
    for any kind of content, addressing audience queries related to politics, science
    and breaking news events. We are planning to add more messaging services such
    as Lime, Telegram, Viber, Instagram and many more. \n\nInterested in a demo? Get

  body: "This is part 2 of a [two-part series](https://meedan.com/blog/3-more-things-we-learned-about-cohesive-action-from-the-reboot/)\n\nThis
    past Wednesday, three Meedanis had a chance to attend The Reboot’s Masterclass
    on “[Designing Collaborations for Urgent, Courageous Change](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/),”
    a 1.5-hour session on cross-sector collaboration. We will be sharing our team's
    insights for the other two sessions of this webinar series. \n\nAs the workshop
    describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse coalitions to advance
    equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts must draw on the radical
    imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our activists, the innovation
    of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence of our media, the values
    of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the private sector, and the
    reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work at the intersection of
    a number of different sectors — journalists, academics, policy researchers, human
    rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale, and so this is a topic
    close to our heart. Here are three things we learned from speakers [Panthea Lee,
    Founder and Executive Director of The Reboot](https://reboot.org/team/panthea-lee/)
    and [Chelsey Lepage, Associate Director of Programs](https://reboot.org/team/chelsey-lepage/):\n\n__Program
    and initiative design can look like agile product development, starting with the
    problem and people.__\n\nFocus on the problem first, invite fewer subject matter
    experts to the table and more the people that need the solution. Chelsey Lepage
    suggested framing the problem as a hunch to make everyone collaborating more comfortable
    when giving inputs. It was insightful to see design and product development concepts
    applied to program work in such a clear manner.\n\nIn agile product development,
    defining a good problem statement is always a challenge, and if it is not well-crafted,
    the user need (solution) will be unmet. Making sure the team and users are involved
    in the framing is the key. Otherwise, all those hours spent on meetings, coding
    and design will have resulted in something —  in this context, an initiative —
    that will never be used. \n\nDuring the webinar, other concepts drew on that shared
    parallel such as “success criteria''. Knowing what criteria must be met so it
    is considered a success and how you will measure and identify it is also a core
    part of the product development cycle. They are embedded in the user stories,
    so every feature built brings value and is solving a user need. In program design
    this was presented in the same way: how will you know that an objective in your
    program was met? What will success look like? The Reboot’s webinar made clear
    that such as it is in product development, a fruitful initiative design is impossible
    without true collaboration.\n\n— *Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America*\n\n__When
    developing a collaboration, work on building relationships before focusing on
    the technical challenges you hope to address together.__\n\nWhen launching or
    developing a collaboration, the webinar leads emphasized the importance of thinking
    about collaborations as ongoing journeys, with interpersonal relationships to
    develop and strengthen before technical challenges become the focus. Presenters
    emphasized that this happens with multiple touchpoints to strengthen the collaboration,
    to build social cohesion, and to have “conversations as humans first, and as representatives
    of an organization second”. As organizations work to develop strong and long-term
    collaborations, the webinar emphasized that relationship building early on can
    help strengthen the interpersonal accountability that can help with achieving
    success as a team. \n\nOver the last decade, Meedan has prioritized the development
    of a global community of contributors and collaborators, working together to build
    impactful projects at the intersection of information equity and accessibility,
    global journalism and digital literacy. This webinar emphasized an important value
    that we as an organization hold dear: as we continue to develop collaborations
    to address the pressing global challenges of today, we’re committed to centralizing
    the focus on all forms of expertise, ensuring that all stakeholders are part of
    collaboration design, and strengthening the foundational relationships that enable
    success and maximize the impact we can realize together. \n\n— *Nat Gyenes, Senior
    Program Manager and Lead, Digital Health Lab*\n\n__Living Expertise is a valuable
    form of expertise that’s often overlooked in favor of formal training and education.__\n\nThe
    webinar discussed the concept of Living Experts, defined as those who “understand
    the lived experience of a problem or context.” These experts sit alongside a diversity
    of perspectives in cross-sector collaboration, such as technical experts, decision
    makers, implementers and allies. “Take an expensive view of ‘expertise’,” noted
    the webinar leaders. At Check Global and in [Meedan programs](https://meedan.com/projects)
    overall, we aim to center different forms of expertise, and this framework made
    a lot of sense for how we try to implement our initiatives.\n\n— *Mina Xiao, Operations*"

  body: "As global journalism grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of challenges
    to press freedom remain. But the crisis also presents an opportunity to reimagine
    media in a post COVID-19 world. In time with World Press Fredom Day, we are launching
    our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/),
    our community for non-profits and collectives working in the area of independent
    media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) in emerging economies.\n\nWith
    our mission to support global journalism, Meedan cares deeply about press freedom
    around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenges we’ve been
    monitoring and writing about through our [Checklist](https://meedan.com/checklist)
    newsletter. Some of the trends we’ve seen are deeply concerning:\n\n### Journalists
    are on the frontlines of the pandemic\nJournalists have been on the frontlines
    reporting the pandemic in different regions. Reporters have been going to hospitals
    and other hotspots where the risk of exposure to the virus and infection is very
    high. Several media outlets do not have or cannot provide proper personal protective
    equipment (PPE) for their staff. According to the [Committee for the Protection
    of Journalists (CPJ), there is risk of the pandemic impacting journalists’ physical
    health and psychological well-being](https://cpj.org/blog/2020/04/qa-us-photographers-navigate-a-new-reality-under-c.php).
    \ \n\n### Media jobs are facing historic losses\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not
    only exposed media workers to physical vulnerabilities, it has also decimated
    an already battered media sector, with many companies reducing hours, holding
    back salaries or simply sacking their media staff outright, according to the [South
    Asia Press Freedom Report](https://samsn.ifj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/States-of-Control-IFJ-SAPFR-2019-20.pdf).
    Shrinking revenue from advertisements, serious disruptions in circulation of newspapers
    and printed publications and a severe strain on limited revenues have resulted
    in a job crisis where reporters and journalists across the world are [experiencing
    pay cuts, reduced hiring and layoffs](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/here-are-the-newsroom-layoffs-furloughs-and-closures-caused-by-the-coronavirus/).
    \ \n\n### Democracies are undermining press freedom\n[Over the last two and a
    half months, the International Press Institute’s (IPI) COVID-19 tracker has documented
    a total of 162 different press freedom violations related to the coronavirus](https://ipi.media/covid19-media-freedom-monitoring/).
    These range from verbal or physical attacks on journalists to arrests, restrictions
    on access to information and media censorship. This has created a hostile and
    challenging environment for independent media and press freedom. Several agencies
    also note that the current pandemic has given states an opportunity to exercise
    greater control over the media. IPI has also documented 16 cases of ‘fake news’
    laws either being passed with disproportionate penalties or used to take down
    content about the virus online. IPI notes that while some of these laws are sincere
    but ill-conceived, others appear to deliberately strengthen authoritarian regimes’
    arsenal against the press.\n \n### Local journalism is under threat\nDuring a
    pandemic, people need timely, reliable and unbiased news on local conditions,
    however, the absence of sustainable and robust business models and distribution
    networks for local news is making that increasingly difficult. [These newsrooms
    will have to make strategic shifts in their business models in order to survive
    the pandemic](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/how-local-news-can-survive-and-thrive-during-the-pandemic/).
    \n\n### Journalists grapple with misinformation during a pandemic\nIn times of
    a global pandemic, access to accurate and unbiased information about the disease
    becomes ever more important. It is critical for the media to share verified and
    reliable information. However, the widespread use of social media and other platforms
    to share unverified information, often without scientific proof, can be dangerous
    and life threatening in the current situation. [UN chief António Guterres noted](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity)
    that \"the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading,\" using a word coined by Meedan
    researchers.  [UNESCO is promoting two social media campaigns “to fight the infodemic
    of rumours and disinformation”](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373354_eng.locale=en).
    UNESCO has also created a COVID- 19 resource centre for media. This online platform
    aims to help journalists track false information regarding the pandemic and report
    on the crisis reliably and effectively, as encouraged by the theme of World Press
    Freedom Day 2020, “journalism without fear or favour”.\n\nAt the same time, as
    [Meedan board member Maria Ressa wrote recently](https://time.com/5820620/maria-ressa-coronavirus-democracy/),
    “The mission of independent journalism has never been as important as it is today,
    when decisions are being made without transparency. Now more than ever, facts
    matter. Truth matters. Checks and balances matter.” It’s vital that those working
    for media freedom around the world come together to re-envision what this can
    look like.\n\nIn time with World Press Freedom Day, Meedan is thrilled to launch
    our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
    The network is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
    working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin America
    (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA).\n\nOur partners from
    different regions will participate in the launch of the Check Global Network this
    week. The network will provide its members access to opportunities and forums
    for sharing, learning and reflection. The main activities will focus on capacity
    building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational development,
    providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be part of a growing
    impactful community."

    "I'm going to the grocery store asap," my friend texted me a few weeks ago, at the peak of the confusion around COVID-19 in the US. He'd heard word from a friend of a friend that President Trump was going to declare a nationwide quarantine. The text came through with urgency and authority --- the President was going to invoke the Stafford Act, the National Guard was going to be called in, and no one would be allowed outside their homes for two weeks.

    It wasn't true, but it felt true, and it felt especially true in the early morning hours when I got the message. I could feel in my bones a sense of dread --- wait, maybe this time it's real? California and New York were already shutting down. President Trump did declare a national emergency using the Stafford Act. There were indeed [credible recommendations from epidemiologists](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-13/coronavirus-shopping-list-your-essential-quarantine-items) that we stock up for two weeks in case we need to quarantine. And the [National Guard had already been called](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814164923/new-york-state-deploys-national-guard-to-manage-coronavirus-in-nyc-suburb) into a number of outbreak zones in the United States.

    The problem comes in the shades of gray: the Stafford Act does grant enormous powers to the President, but [national quarantine is not one of them](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/19/fact-check-does-stafford-act-allow-trump-order-quarantine/2872743001/). The National Guard has been deployed, not to enforce anything remotely resembling martial law but instead to help with [cleaning, testing and food delivery](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21188088/coronavirus-national-guard-testing-food-cleaning-martial). Cities and states have indeed issued shelter-in-place orders, but [the federal government doesn't have direct power](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/825293201/a-president-is-not-able-to-order-a-national-quarantine-experts-say) over these. Around the world, we're indeed  seeing national lockdowns in places like India, China and Hungary, with tremendous implications on civil rights. In this context, it might not be unreasonable to think that a military-enforced quarantine might be coming for the United States.

    [A recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-text-messages-national-quarantine.html) pointed out that false and misleading information is part of an ongoing problem in the wake of the pandemic: "With the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the world, misinformation has followed suit," the article noted. It continues:

    Other [SMS] messages in recent weeks, reflecting the same pattern, have warned that New York City public transit would shut down last week (it's still running), or that the entire Pacific Northwest would be quarantined last week (also not true). At least one message said that President Trump would declare a national emergency within three days --- Mr. Trump declared the emergency on Friday, but that did not give him the power to impose a national quarantine.

    ![Meedan sms 2](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/Qad98m6x2PoDGg9WD0DaW/91f2f80e2539ad70eec5389dd59470c6/Meedan_sms_2.png)

    Over the past year, the misinformation research community has been sounding the alarm about deepfakes, [a form of synthetic media](https://lab.witness.org/projects/synthetic-media-and-deep-fakes/) (i.e., media made by artificial intelligence) wherein people are made to look like they're saying or doing something that they're not. In January of this year, as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was spreading across China and --- as we would later learn --- much of the world, [Facebook announced a ban on AI-generated videos](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-us-election). That same month, [William A. Galston at the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-seeing-still-believing-the-deepfake-challenge-to-truth-in-politics/) warned that "If AI is reaching the point where it will be virtually impossible to detect audio and video representations of people saying things they never said (and even doing things they never did), seeing will no longer be believing, and we will have to decide for ourselves---without reliable evidence---whom or what to believe."

    Galston wrote these words with an eye on the upcoming 2020 election in the US, but just a few months later, the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly placed the US election into the background of national conversations. Furthermore, the misinformation thriving now is not deepfakes but cheap fakes --- what [Data & Society researchers Britt Paris and Joan Donovan](https://datasociety.net/library/deepfakes-and-cheap-fakes/) define as "an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing." Cheap fakes can simply be miscontextualized videos, like one going viral on [WhatsApp purportedly showing panicked mobs in the Netherlands](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/03/13/monitoring-and-debunking-covid-19-panic-the-haarlem-aldi-hoax/). 

    But much of today's pandemic misinformation is proving to be even simpler: what I call text fakes --- the oldest form of media manipulation, made possible by the ability to put words on a page, or a screen, or spread it around rapidly on private messaging apps. 

    The text fake goes back to the days of scrolls and pamphlets. [The ancient Romans engaged in information combat](https://www.ft.com/content/aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6), using the literary implements of their time to spread disinformation and confusion. But it was the rise of moveable type in the 15th century that soon yielded pamphleteering as a popular medium for politics. As such, they became an early source of text fakes: "Cheap and made on the smallest sheets of paper," noted [one article in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-we-solved-fake-news-the-first-time), "pamphlets were written for attention and money. How do you get attention? Then, as now, successful strategies included exaggeration and hating others (in the pamphlets' case, Catholics). Elaborate conspiracy theories were popular, too." Essayist and pamphleteer Jonathan Swift famously observed that "falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after." 

    Much of the deepfake discussion in 2019 focused lagely on the content of synthetic media --- what the media shows, how to detect it, what it might say, how it might mislead. Cheap fakes and text fakes floating around private messaging apps and public social media are, alternatively, a reminder of the importance of the context of media --- the mental state of the recipient, the narrative discourse in media and the general public, the relationship between the person sending the message and the person(s) receiving it, the political situation in the region, and a variety of other factors that influence how we interpret a piece of content, whether it's a piece of text or a fully-manipulated video.

    The history of writing suggests that as more people gain access to writing tools and the ability to manipulate the written word, the more we see misinformation in text. We should expect the same of video, with the rise of video editing tools and synthetic media. Beware the text fake --- it's a powerful reminder that when content flies around the internet, our understanding of its context still comes limping after.

  body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
    we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
    is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
    is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
    two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you have
    water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
    economies where most of the population live in [urban dense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html)
    areas the outcome of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to
    remember the power we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create
    new and inclusive pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts
    as a speaker and as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon
    in México, which occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n> \"Para
    cambiar los medios necessitamos cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media we will
    need to change it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO of Chicas
    Poderosas, at the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This speech set the
    tone for the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas an all-female
    digital media professinals network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn a historic building
    at the center of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican states got together for
    two days with the goal of creating multimedia projects on subjects relevant to
    their context and based on the current sexual assaults occurring in the country.
    \n\nTo get to this meeting spot you would have to first find yourself on a street
    right behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic church that is part of a series
    of buildings that stand today on top of what used to be The Templo Mayor, the
    heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event started, the women took pictures first
    of the stage and the speakers, but slowly as they started to chat with each other
    during the activities of the day, selfies emerged— a prelude to the professional
    relationships and friendships that were forged at these events. Despite the grey
    building, colors were abundant in Chicas banners, participant's hairs, [pañuelos](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2019/06/08/color-por-color-que-significan-los-24-panuelos-que-se-venden-en-las-calles-portenas/)
    and children's toys. \n\n\nA little girl was running between the participants'
    tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with her mother's camera.
    A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced and taken care of by
    the community. In Latin America there is an increasing number of women self identifying
    as [household heads](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/unequal-family-lives/families-in-latin-america/27F2E01B797AD1489A238BFDF2075F1C/core-reader),
    and as they become mothers the participation in professional events declines,
    as do career development opportunities. This effect is known as the [baby penalty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813
    \"Baby Penalty\"). The presence of kids in this event set a precedent for Chicas,
    and in 2020 all Mediathons will make clear in their calls to the community that
    mothers and children are welcome *(due to COVID-19 pandemic Mediathons will be
    held online)*. \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those
    of a call for action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist
    spaces, and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was composed
    of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers, and journalists.
    All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of diverse personalities:
    a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\n### The Mediathon Model:
    Building a community by building safe spaces\n\nTo ensure that the room was transformed
    into a safe space, [rules of behavior ](http://chicaspoderosas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Co%CC%81digo-Chicas-ES.pdf
    \"Chicas Code of conduct\")and engagement were shared as soon as the event began.
    Chicas defines a safe a place as one that is free of social, cultural, racial
    and sexual oppression. The material with the code of conduct was sent to the participants
    beforehand, and they were reminded by the organizers that they were always available
    to answer any questions and to help if something that violated the code or made
    them feel uncomfortable happened. A few members were defined as the go-to people
    for any woman that felt the code was violated. There were only a few men present,
    of those, most were working at the catering service and only a couple representing
    NGOs that were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons are made real thanks
    to Chicas volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in which they run an event.
    The team organizing it was composed of members that first started by attending
    or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around Latin America, which is
    a common way to get to know and be a part of the community. In this case, most
    of them were not from México City and had instead traveled from distant provinces.
    \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered around a contextualized
    issue, in this case, violence against women in México. The first segment involved
    local NGOs and communities presenting their work on gender violence, violence
    against women journalists, abortion and reproductive rights. After that, the participants
    decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate further, and teams formed around
    the multimedia projects. On the second day,  women leaders in their field presented
    issues on which they are experts, such as online engagement, online security,
    and fact-checking tools (this last one was presented by a zombie-like me while
    I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX dry climate). After this, they worked on
    the projects with their mentors and at the end presented their multimedia projects
    and timelines.\n\nThe highlight of this experience was when one of the participants
    started presenting her project in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped,
    shouted and, safe to say, I had goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that
    systematically erased (and still does) the existence of the indigenous population,
    it was humbling to hear that ancient and important language. That woman speaking
    summed to me what Chicas is about: sharing and saving space for underrepresented
    voices that shape our communities. \n\n### One-month mentoring projects\n\nThe
    projects presented were about a myriad of subjects: abortion, sexuality, a radio
    community directed to indigenous women focusing on fighting gender violence in
    6 different local languages, child and teenage pregnancies, masculinity and gender
    roles. \n\n[Here](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/historias-que-ponen-nuestras-vocesenalza-ad1b31907010)
    you can check out the amazing work that was published after the one-month mentoring

    at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
    in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is working
    on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate, sustain
    and expand their community using digital tools. This year one of the initiatives
    we will be supporting Chicas is the [Conversaciones Poderosas en La Pandemia COVID-19](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/conversacionespoderosas-en-la-pandemia-de-covid-19-71daa8ea523f
    \"Conversaciones Poderosas\"), a space to talk about the various challenges that
    the pandemic presents on a professional and personal level for journalists, share
    ideas on how to face them and exchange points of view from different countries.
    The objective is to create a space of containment, learning and accompaniment
    for the community."

  body: "This week, Meedan welcomes medical doctor and award-winning journalist, Dr.
    Seema Yasmin to our COVID-19 team. \n\nHer role will include sharing highlights
    from Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database, a new tool supported by major tech funders
    and foundations, which engages public health experts to provide newsworthy insights
    into complex pandemic science. \n\nYou’ll be able to find Dr. Yasmin’s highlights
    in our weekly newsletter, The Checklist, and on even more platforms soon. [Sign
    up](https://meedan.com/checklist) for the Checklist. To learn more about the COVID-19
    Expert Database or to see how your newsroom or fact-checking organization can
    get involved, email <a href=\"health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>. \n\n“Journalists
    are under immense pressure to report quickly, frequently, and accurately, during
    the pandemic,” said Dr. Yasmin. “That requires sifting through dozens of new studies
    published each day, analyzing complex methodology, and translating technical language
    into content for broad audiences — in addition to protecting the public from false
    narratives and dangerous myths spread by some politicians and bad actors. The
    Expert Database supports reporters and fact-checkers, helping them verify information
    so they can publish the kind of nuanced, accurate, and up-to-date content that
    the public demands during the global health crisis of our generation.\"\n\nEach
    week, Dr. Yasmin will curate key selections from the COVID-19 Expert Database
    and provide an added layer of context onto those pieces of information. This will
    help fact-checkers and journalists who use the COVID-19 Expert Database understand
    the most important content from around the world.\n\nDr. Yasmin is a physician-journalist
    who served as an officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention, before training as a journalist and reporting
    on the front lines of epidemics such as of Ebola, Zika, gun violence, and more.
    She trained in journalism at the University of Toronto and in medicine at the
    University of Cambridge. \n\nYasmin was [a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in
    breaking news](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2017) in 2017 with
    a team from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting
    on neglected diseases. She has received two grants from the Pulitzer Center on
    Crisis Reporting and in 2017 she was selected as a John S. Knight Fellow in Journalism
    at Stanford University where she investigated the spread of health misinformation
    and disinformation during epidemics.\n\nWe are excited to work with Dr. Yasmin
    on amplifying these highlights to our audience. Stay tuned for more updates on
    the COVID-19 Expert Database soon, including more platforms for broadcasting highlights
    and an introduction to our entire team of experts.\n"

  body: "Over the past few weeks, a number of Meedan team members have been attending
    Reboot’s online series on [Driving Transformative Collaboration](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/).
    As the workshop describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse
    coalitions to advance equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts
    must draw on the radical imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our
    activists, the innovation of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence
    of our media, the values of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the
    private sector, and the reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work
    at the intersection of a number of different sectors — journalists, academics,
    policy researchers, human rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale,
    and so this is a topic close to our heart. We wrote previously about insights
    we gained from the first event. Here are three more from the most recent two events:\n\n###
    Do the work before the work.\n\nWorking with different sectors and personas from
    all over the world, we found it really helpful to “do the work before the work”
    and understand our collaborators’ interests, anxieties and agendas before getting
    together. Knowing about their journeys and impact will allow us to introduce unheard
    perspectives and this can be extended to our collaborators themselves getting
    to know each other! We can do this by creating materials and sharing a synthesized
    version across the collaborators of a specific project, we can then ground on
    the communalities we have and we may think about a shared problem ahead of time.\n\n\n###
    Document document document. Even when it’s hard.\n\nThe Reboot team shared an
    all-too-familiar sentiment with participants about the often conflicted relationship
    that can be experienced with documentation – it can take quite some time to develop
    the documentation that teams need to stay organized and aligned, but these documents
    are well worth the investment. Keeping information up-to-date and organized can
    help to ensure expectations are shared and agreed-upon by the team, and a short-term
    investment in documentation can help prevent challenges in alignment in the future.
    \n\n\n### When everything’s important, create structures for alignment.\n\nIt
    can seem like everything’s important. And that’s true. But that also creates barrier
    for getting a project started. The Arc of Alignment that Reboot’s team articulated
    enables an excellent framework, which felt very much like a masterclass in meeting
    facilitation. “Brainstorm, with Bumpers” is something I think all program and
    product managers have to navigate, and the toolkit they’ve provided is one we
    use a lot at Meedan - facilitated conversation through structured whiteboarding
    and post-it sessions, followed by group prioritization. The brainstorming is part
    of the work, and with that necessarily comes tension. How teams navigate that
    tension is part of what distinguishes success from struggles.\n\nThis is part
    2 of a [two-part series](https://meedan.com/blog/3-things-we-learned-on-designing-collaborations-from-the-reboots-masterclass/)."

  body: "In July 2018, I traveled to Zimbabwe to join The Carter Center to work with
    civil society organizations and newsrooms on tracking and addressing misinformation
    around the first harmonized elections in the country after Robert Mugabe stepped
    down.\n\nWhen I arrived in Zimbabwe, election-related propaganda was all over
    news media and social media. As an Egyptian, I was all too familiar with this
    kind of information ecosystem: mainstream media is owned by the state, and its
    goal is simply to amplify and spread one side of the story — that of those in
    power. Wandering the streets of Harare, it was impossible not to notice the dominance
    of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ([Zanu-PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU%E2%80%93PF))
    in its use of posters and billboards. Zimbabwe’s digital streets — Facebook, Twitter,
    YouTube, were similarly flooded with pro-Zanu-PF content: memes, articles, and
    videos all designed and spread to support the long-time ruling party.\n\nThough
    we had worked for more than a decade in North Africa, at the time our work in
    sub-saharan Africa was in its early days. Meedan was in the middle of developing
    a network in East Africa, which included launching a partnership with [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)
    to support the fact-checking ecosystem in the region. Fact-checkers at PesaCheck
    integrated Meedan’s open source toolkit, [Check](http://meedan.com/en/check),
    into their workflows and verified statements from public figures in Kenya, Uganda
    and Tanzania. \n\nComing to Zimbabwe in 2018, we found a nation and people full
    of hope and looking for the political change needed to address decades of corruption
    and the challenges of [their brutal economic situation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview).
    In an earlier [post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
    this year, I wrote about how Robert Mugabe’s retirement from his presidency in
    2017 opened up the region to a new era. Our invitation to join the Carter Center
    team in Zimbabwe to help partners monitor and assess the role of online mis and
    disinformation represented [the first time in more than a decade that international
    election observers](https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/commonwealth/africa/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-and-election-observation-missions/)
    were able to monitor an election in Zimbabwe, and as such certainly represented
    the first online election media analysis effort there. . In this spirit the 2018
    Zimbabwe presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections (harmonized
    elections) took place on July 30, 2018.\n\n[Our collaborations in Zimbabwe](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
    included the fact-checking initiative [ZimFact](https://zimfact.org/) as well
    as the Centre for Innovation & Technology ([CITE](http://www.cite.org.zw/about-us/)),
    a group in South Zimbabwe that supports initiatives led by youths, journalists,
    and designers. \n\n\n### A new phase of Check Global: Post-Election Narratives\n\nThe
    Kenya elections in 2017 were “marred by serious human rights violations, including
    unlawful killings and beatings by police during protests and house-to-house operations”
    according to[ Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse).
    Under those circumstances, Check Global fact-checking partners CITE (in Zimbabwe)
    \ and PesaCheck  (in Kenya) continued to verify social media evidence after the
    elections and focused on how to hold politicians accountable to their constituencies.\n\nCurrently,
    PesaCheck in Kenya is building a prototype of Wajibisha, which means “to hold
    accountable,” a promise tracker with a focus on fact-checking budgetary promises
    and election promises, for initial deployment in Kenya and Uganda. Promises are
    logged on Meedan 's Check platform covering the following thematic areas - Health,
    Housing, Jobs, Governance, Environment, Traffic Management and Social Inclusion
    (Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities). Updates on the progress of delivery
    on these promises will then reflect on the main promise tracker website, which
    is not yet available to the general public but will be soon.\n\nEric Mugendi,
    the managing editor of PesaCheck, explains their use of Check:: \n\n> \"Check
    as a platform has enabled us to collaborate both within and outside our organization
    to fact-check and verify content. Our team is distributed in three countries,
    and we work on different platforms. Check allows us to keep track of what everyone
    is doing, and ensures that our work is done to the same standard. We are exploring
    new ways to use the platform, and the most promising one so far is in keeping
    track of promises by elected figures. \"\n\nIn Zimbabwe, CITE is working on [The
    Digital Media for Accountability Project](https://www.cite.org.zw/category/factcheckzw/).
    This is an innovative project that combines digital technology, journalistic fact-checking
    skills and capacity building to promote social accountability at the local government
    level. Focusing mainly on Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second capital city, the project
    aims to track and check statements made by the Bulawayo City Council. CITE continues
    to use Check in their daily fact-checking workflow to provide citizens with timely,
    relevant and accurate information on issues of local governance, service delivery
    and public resources management. \n\nCalling Check’s workflow “harmonious” and
    “intuitive,” Sean Ndlovu, co-founder of CITE, said: \n\n> \"The Check platform
    has allowed us at CITE to be able to follow up on announcements, promises and
    proclamations made by local authorities in Zimbabwe in a systematic and archival
    way. The Check platform also allows us to collaborate as a team by assigning tasks
    to each other in a seamless way thus helping the team to report on claims in a
    simple and standardised format. \"\n\n### Check Global intersections with different
    projects at Meedan\n\nWe’ve also expanded our work with our current Check Global
    partners in East Africa in that it  is also feeding the capacity of our Claims
    and Memes Database (CMDb) project. The CMDb project was possible by the generous
    support of Open Tech Fund (OTF), and it's an API-accessible repository of fact
    checked claims and debunked visual misinformation from internet repressive countries,
    where disinformation and social network manipulation have become key censorship
    strategies. As we witnessed visual misinformation travel between Kenya and Zimbabwe
    during the elections, we realized the importance of creating an annotated and
    verified database for claims and memes. \n\nIn July 2019, I was honored to travel
    to Kenya to participate in a collaborative pop-up newsroom to counter misinformation
    during the Kenyan census. This effort was organized by Meedan and supported by
    Article 19. During this pop-up workshop we collected, annotated, and verified
    Kenyan memes based on the census.\n\n### What's new for Check Global in East Africa
    in 2020?\n\nAs the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced the COVID-19 outbreak
    as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
    and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied across
    platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual information
    around the virus.\n\nEast African countries face different challenges on many
    levels, not only in terms of weakened [public health services](https://time.com/5816299/coronavirus-africa-ventilators-doctors/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=world_&linkId=85995855)
    and infrastructure, but also rising [mis/disinformation on social media platforms](https://www.article19.org/resources/coronavirus-new-article-19-briefing-on-tackling-misinformation/),
    lacking [access to public records and information](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/why-access-to-information-on-covid-19-is-crucial-to-persons-with-disabilities-in-africa/),
    [severe cutbacks to free speech](https://ifex.org/covid-19-in-africa-right-to-information-another-casualty-with-spike-in-attacks-on-journalists/),
    [internet and telecom accessibility issues](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-internet-is-making-stay-at-home-difficult-for-africans/a-53048013),
    and worsening [civil rights violations](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/cipesa-submission-to-un-special-rapporteur-spotlights-rights-concerns-in-africas-covid-19-response/).\n\n__Meedan
    launched [new COVID-19 microgrants](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/)__
    to support independent media projects in Africa. Our goal was to support journalists,
    activists and citizen journalists to explore open source investigations and verification
    storytelling. \n\nWe are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely in East Africa
    with our partners, with whom we are discussing and adapting new ways of virtual
    training programs that, while it will no longer require the physical attendance
    of participants, will continue to keep them involved. \n\n[CITE](https://www.cite.org.zw/)
    just launched an online learning platform '[Funda](http://funda.cite.org.zw/)'
    (meaning 'learn' in [Ndebele](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ndebele-Zimbabwean-people)),
    relying on online learning resources from [Nawa Media](https://nawamedia.org/courses/),
    a separate Check Global project that brings together journalism students across
    five countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) across North Africa,
    West Asia to instill the next generation of Arab-speaking journalists with open-source
    investigation tools, fact-checking skills, and an acumen for digital and media
    literacy. \n\nSeparately, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) is creating two
    massive open online courses (MOOC), one on general fact-checking processes using
    Check and another on how to build Promise Tracking using Check. PesaCheck will
    conduct virtual training using these modules with four different newsrooms in
    Kenya.\n\n\nThis increased inter-partner collaboration, not only manifested in
    East Africa, has accelerated and strengthened Meedan’s aspirations to bring our
    partners together within the [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
    The Network  virtually launched on May 5, 2020.. \n\n\n### Events\n\nIn light
    of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not attending events this year, as a number of
    the conferences we typically attend have been canceled. That said, we are moving
    this energy online and hosting  a series of online conversations. Please stay
    tuned for more info on these virtual events by following us on social media or
    on our newsletter. \n\nWe invite all our partners to send us tips and ideas for

  body: "All injustices have at their core an abuse of power. Systemic injustices
    ingrain these abuses into the structure of our societies, into the mechanics of
    how power, money, opportunity, and—as the past months have made so brutally apparent—health
    is accessed and distributed. \n\nAs an organization that is ultimately built on
    the premise that truth and knowledge are contextual, we have an obligation to
    the truth that exceeds our commitment to non-partisanship. We in the strongest
    possible terms condemn the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and we
    criticize US national leadership, whose lack of contrition and unwillingness or
    inability to empathize with the very clear sentiments of millions of Americans
    in this moment is a profound and damaging failure.\n\nMeedan, while founded in
    the US, is a global technology non-profit working with media partners around the
    world, primarily in the global south. Our partners work to document human rights
    abuses in Yemen, uncover political corruption in the Philippines, and empower
    young investigative journalists and fact-checkers in Africa. We have designed
    our organization in response to the single question: \"What can we do as engineers,
    program managers, researchers and designers to address injustice and inequity
    in digital spaces?\"\n\nThis moment of social rage is of profound concern. We
    must demand more of our institutions and of our leaders, especially with regards
    to systemic racism against Black communities. Every sector of our society from
    the institutions of our government, to our corporations, to the media, to our
    universities, to the technology platforms, to organizations like ours must make
    an aggressively anti-racist approach core to our business models, our missions
    and our daily work.\n\nAt Meedan we commit to honoring the memory of George Floyd,
    Breonna Taylor, and all those whose lives and livelihoods have been harmed by
    anti-blackness, racism, hatred and disinformation. So much more needs to be done,
    and we commit to using our work---our tools, our programs, and our research---to
    helping in this effort.\n\n\n— Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan\n\n"

  body: "To wake up in Brazil in 2020 is to confront daily headlines that send us
    back to 1968, our years of military dictatorship. We see headlines such as: Brazilian
    President Jair Bolsonaro [suspends](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/07/bolsonaro-removes-surging-coronavirus-death-toll-official-websites/
    \"Bolsonaro removes number of deaths\") publication of number of deaths; the government
    demands a [recount](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/governo-vai-recontar-numero-de-mortos-por-covid-19-diz-secretario-da-saude.shtml
    \"Bolsonaro's govenament wants to recount the number of deaths \") of the death
    numbers saying they are \"inflated\". Meanwhile Brazilian scientists estimate
    that the number of underreported victims of COVID-19 is [seven times higher](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/numero-de-casos-de-covid-19-no-brasil-pode-ser-ate-sete-vezes-maior-do-que-oficial-diz-pesquisa-1-24445874
    \"Number of deaths can be seven times higher than the official numbers, says research\")
    than what has been reported. This means that according to the [official data](https://www.publico.pt/2020/06/05/mundo/noticia/brasil-morre-pessoa-minuto-devido-covid19-1919572
    \"According to offcial data one person dies per minute due to covid-19 in Brazil\"),every
    minute, a person dies from COVID-19 in Brazil. \n\nIn Latin America the erasure
    of data and memory, lack of transparency and the rise of scientific and [historical](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml
    \"Bolsonaro denies the existance of Brazil's military dictatorship past\") denialism
    is nothing new, much less in Brazil. For a [brief period ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/referencia-global-sobre-covid-19-universidade-johns-hopkins-interrompe-contagem-de-dados-do-brasil-1-24466845?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=O%20Globo
    \"Johns Hopkins University interrupts feed of Brazil COVID-19 data\")of time this
    week, Brazil was removed from the Johns Hopkins University ranking that globally
    counts the number of victims of the pandemic. This was a result of the decision
    taken on June 2nd by Bolsonaro to [take down](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/governo-esconde-totais-de-mortes-casos-da-covid-19-tira-site-do-ar-1-24466314
    \"Brazillian governament takes down COVID-19 death numbers from official website\")
    the website that provides data on deaths by COVID-19 in the country. Upon making
    them available again this Friday, the government decided that it would focus on
    the number of [victims recovered ](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/portal-da-covid-19-volta-ao-ar-mas-sem-total-de-casos-mortes-sem-planilha-com-dados-detalhados-1-24466899
    \"Offcial Helath portal comes back with data without the numbers breakdown\")and
    those who have died in the past 24 hours. A breakdown of the data by region, and
    by total number of deaths will no longer be available. \n\nThe government also
    decided to recount the dead and check the math as it believes the numbers were
    [\"made up\"](https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/bela-megale/post/ministerio-da-saude-vai-recontar-mortos-pela-covid-19-porque-diz-ver-dados-fantasiosos.html
    \"Governament wants to recount the numbers saying they are made up\"). It is not
    the first time that this government has questioned the data provided by scientific
    organizations. In July 2019, when asked about the exponential growth of deforestation
    in the Amazon,the Chief Minister of the Institutional Security Office, General
    Augusto Heleno, said that the data was [\"manipulated\"](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/indices-de-desmatamento-na-amazonia-sao-manipulados-diz-ministro-augusto-heleno.shtml
    \"Minister Augusto Heleno says Amazon deforestation data was manipulated\") by
    the National Institute for Space Research (INSPE). More recently, this scientific
    denialism has manifested in the firing of the Women's Health Coordination Team
    at the Ministry of Health, due to the publication of a technical note that addresses
    access to sexual and reproductive health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Several organizations [denounced](http://www.visibilidadefeminina.org/noticias
    \"Visibilidade Feminina website\") this decision, among them Visibilidade Feminina
    (Feminine Visibility), a non-profit civil organization that aims to promote the
    role of women in public and private spaces of power.\n\nThe majority of the victims
    in the COVID-19 pandemic are black, according to a survey by [Agência Pública](https://apublica.org/2020/05/em-duas-semanas-numero-de-negros-mortos-por-coronavirus-e-cinco-vezes-maior-no-brasil/
    \"In two weeks the number of black vistims is five times higher\"), and they are
    victims of a racist and genocidal policy imposed by the Bolsonaro government which
    [plays down the effects of the pandemic](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/23/americas/brazil-coronavirus-hospitals-intl/index.html
    \"CNN article on Brazil hospitals\"). The number of black victims with low literacy
    is four times higher than that of white people with a higher education level,
    as revealed by the [research carried](http://www.ctc.puc-rio.br/diferencas-sociais-confirmam-que-pretos-e-pardos-morrem-mais-de-covid-19-do-que-brancos-segundo-nt11-do-nois/
    \"Research says that more black people die due to COVID-19\") out by PUC-RIO.
    And this week we also learned that the virus is [twice as lethal](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-humanos/noticia/2020-06/covid-19-agrava-violacoes-contra-indigenas-yanomami-diz-estudo
    \" Study says COVID-19 agravates violations against Yanomamis\")  to the Yanomami
    tribe, and due to the mining and deforestation activities [supported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-amazon-indigenous.html
    \"Bolsonaro governament and the Amazon\") by Bolsonaro's government in the Amazon
    forest, they are even more vulnerable. Scientists currently estimate a 6.45% death
    rate among the Yanomami population, according to [a study](https://acervo.socioambiental.org/acervo/publicacoes-isa/o-impacto-da-pandemia-na-terra-indigena-yanomami-foragarimpoforacovid
    \"Study about the impact of the pandemic on the Yanomami population\") conducted
    by the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) and the Federal University of Minas Gerais.\n\n###
    Learning from our recent past \n\nState violence, such as what we are living through
    today, generates [trauma](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30408012
    \"Moment of Truth for Brazil's military past\") in the fabric of society that
    needs to be repaired to avoid a repeat of our recent past, where there has been
    an erasure of popular history of collective resistance. After the transitional
    justice process post-dictartorship was done we did not, for example, [hold the
    military to account](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2019-01-01/ghosts-brazils-military-dictatorship
    \"Ghosts of Brazil's military dictatorship\").\n\nOne lesson we did learn was
    the importance of memory as a practice of resistance. By preserving historical
    artifacts such as testimonies, documents, images and videos during and after the
    dictatorship period we were able, more or less effectively, to carry out recovery
    processes through the [National Commission of Truth](https://www.conectas.org/en/news/final-report-of-the-national-truth-commission-what-now-brazil
    \"Final Report of the national truth comission\") that addressed missing persons,
    the exiled and victims of political crimes. After the dictatorship, the Brazilian
    Constitution of 1988 sought to heal some secular wounds as a result of the efforts
    of civil society that demanded the creation of SUS, our universal health system
    which provides access to health for the Brazilian population. It is this same
    system that during the COVID-19 pandemic is collapsing in several states of the
    country, proving that it is [underfunded](https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/o-sus-e-o-direito-a-saude-em-tempos-de-coronavirus/
    \"About SUS and the constitucional right to acess health\"), even while being
    essential.\n\nThe cruelty of this historical moment becomes acute, when, in addition
    to burying our dead in [collective graves](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-brazil-mass-graves-experts-anticipate-covid-19-deaths-2020-5
    \"Photos of Brazil mass graves\"), remembering their lives, and surviving a pandemic,
    we still urgently need to preserve data and documents, in order for compensation
    to be possible in the future to the families of the victims of this policy. \n\n\n###
    Acting while we suffer: online collective mourning and self-organizing \n\nMemory
    as resistance is being articulated by the [Memorial of Victims of COVID-19 in
    Brazil](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
    \"Facebook page of the covid-19 memorial\"), a Facebook page that aims to honor
    victims and tell their stories. And it is one of the initiatives of the [Support
    Network for the Families of Fatal Victims of Covid-19 in Brazil](https://seguraaonda.com.br/nasce-a-rede-de-apoio-as-familias-de-vitimas-fatais-do-covid-19-no-brasil/),
    an emergency network made up of volunteers, professionals and people in solidarity
    with the families of victims in the country, in their honor. The network's objectives
    are to: provide guidance for funerals, burials and farewell rituals and to create
    channels to guarantee the right to memory and wakes (even if virtual) and due
    tribute to the dead. \n\nNews portal [G1](http://especiais.g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/memorial-vitimas-covid-19/#/
    \"G1 COVID-19 omline Memorial\"), has responded to this collective need of mourning
    by creating an online memorial with the victim's obituaries. Another example is
    [Inumeráveis ](https://inumeraveis.com.br/ \"Inumeráveis website\")(Innumerable)
    a collaborative and volunteer virtual memorial effort with the premise that no
    one likes to be a number, according to them, people deserve to exist in prose.
    Their editorial process involves families of the victims, journalists and researchers.
    It was built as a space to celebrate life.\n\nTo articulate how self organizing
    is important for the indigenous population in Brazil in challenging the state
    narrative you only have to compare the numbers of confirmed deaths recorded by
    families and communities with the official numbers that the government shares
    from the Special Indigenous Health Secretariat (Sesai). In some cases they are
    [three times](https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2020/06/01/18-mil-indigenas-sao-infectados-por-covid-19-em-78-povos-no-brasil-diz-organizacao.ghtml
    \"Numbers of infected indigenous population\") higher according to Articulation
    of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil (Apib) their aim is to preserve victims’ memory.\n\n\n###
    Preserving memory as a path forward\n\n> \"Memory is, in itself, an end, a strategy
    to repair the damage caused to human rights and is a way to reconcile a society\"
    comments Professor Isabel Piper Shafir, from the Faculty of Social Sciences at
    the University of Chile, about the post-dictatorship reparation processes in Chile.
    \n\nTo ensure that we can use memory as a strategy for reparation, the work of
    civil organizations, activists, technologists, historians, researchers and journalists
    is essential to the archiving and preservation process. \n\nUnderstanding our
    current information ecosystem can be part of the strategy for the sustainability
    of these archives and collections of data. The memorial of the Covid-19 victims
    in Brazil is hosted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/memorialcoronabrasil/about/?ref=page_internal
    \"Facebook page of the Memorial for Victms of COVID-19 in Brazil\")'s platform;
    in practical terms this means that the content, those collectively woven threads
    of memory, are being stored and held by a corporate social media platform. These
    corporations are becoming the record keepers of a country's history while there
    is still a [total lack of transparency](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/facebook-instagram-lack-transparency-government-ordered-content-removal-amid
    \"EFF: Facebook and Instagram lack transparency\") regarding their content moderation
    policies. Often we don't know why they take something down, leaving their motivation
    unclear and leaving us to wonder: was this content [censored](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive
    \"Instagram shadow bans marginalised communities\")? Was it a technical error?
    Or did it infringe the platform's policies?\n\nA possible response is using open
    source technology to contribute to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard content
    and history, helping to preserve context and ownership, as well as ensuring data
    collection and transparency for future accountability. \n\nThere are several formats
    of how civil organizations and open source communities can cooperate in these
    efforts some examples are: creating open source investigations to collect data
    on the victims of COVID-19 using [Check](https://meedan.com/check \"Check - Meedan
    website\"), or using archiving software such as Huridoc's [Uwazi ](https://www.uwazi.io/
    \"Uwazi website\")to curate and publish human rights documentation that could
    make important, public information more accessible, as well as using the OpenArchive’s
    [app Save](https://open-archive.org/save/ \"Save website\") to streamline media
    workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting while encrypting the media.
    Another open source approach comes from [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/ \"DocNow
    website\") whose focus is on archiving social media activist content, they do
    this by engaging directly with communities and [co-creating](https://news.docnow.io/documenting-activism-now-17db7b956fcf
    \"DocNow blog post on Documenting Activism\") through workshops solutions that
    are customized to their needs and workflows. \n\nLet's learn from our past historical
    erasures and organize ourselves to use current technology to safeguard our memory
    but also to understand the limitations of certain tools and products. Perhaps
    this time around, we can say that in spite of our collective shock and loss we
    honored our loved ones by mourning, remembering and saving space for future reparation.
    And hopefully as we walk on the coronavirus-free streets again we will do it in
    spaces that, different from today, are liberated of rotting statues and avenues
    named after the generals that were responsible for digging mass graves in times
    past. \n"

  body: "Last night we learned that our friend and Meedan Board of Directors member
    Maria Ressa has been convicted of cyber libel and sentenced to serve time in prison
    for these crimes. Here is a quick run-down of the verdict and case details:\n\n-
    On Monday, June 15, Manila Regional Trial Court Judge Rainelda Estacio Montesa
    convicted Rappler CEO and Executive Editor Maria Ressa and former researcher-writer
    Rey Santos Jr of cyber libel. \n- The court sentenced Ressa and Santos to a minimum
    of six months and one day to a maximum of six years in prison.\n- They were released
    on bail pending appeal. Ressa and Santos were also each ordered to pay 200,000
    Philippine pesos (approximately 3,500 euros) in moral damages and 200,000 pesos
    in exemplary damages.\n- Ressa and Reynaldo will not go to prison at this time,
    as the conviction can be appealed and they have the option to exhaust legal remedies
    in higher courts. \n- The cyber-libel case against Ressa is based on an investigative
    report published by Rappler on May 2012. \n- The article said that the then-chief
    justice of the Philippines Supreme Court, Renato Corona, had used vehicles belonging
    to a controversial businessman.\n- The article was republished on February 2014,
    to correct a spelling error, which is a normal practice of news publications.\n-
    In February last year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Ressa and filed
    charges against her, reporter Reynaldo Santos Jr. and Rappler Inc. under the Cybercrime
    Prevention Act, which was enacted on September 2012, four months after the publication
    of the original report in Rappler. \n- The charges stemmed from a complaint by
    the businessman, Wilfredo D. Keng. Authorities initially declined to prosecute
    the case, but later reversed that decision.\n- In the court, the prosecution argued
    that the republication of the article in 2014 to correct a “typo” amounted to
    republication of the story and therefore the cyber libel law could be applied.\nSource:
    [International Press Institute](https://ipi.media/maria-ressa-fearless-journalism-found-guilty/?mc_cid=a0dd6d7110&mc_eid=89968079c7)&
    [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/263817-statement-conviction-maria-ressa-reynaldo-santos-jr-cyber-libel-case)\n\nAcross
    the interwebs there is an outpouring of support for Maria and condemnation of
    this verdict. We add to that our emphatic support for Maria, for Rappler's meticulous
    and ethical journalism, and for the very institution of an open and critical press
    that she has come to embody. \n\nI want to share some personal reflections, some
    context, that might not be known to an international audience who sees her only
    as the Time Magazine person of the year and a global face of press freedom. The
    Maria Ressa I have come to know is most remarkable for the fact that she has built
    a media property to oppose and stand against corruption, violence, and censorship
    while remaining one of the kindest, most modest, and upbeat people I have ever
    encountered. This is not a veneer - it goes straight through to the core of who
    Maria is.  \n\nAnd then there is the way Maria thinks. Anyone who has ever been
    involved in a project with Maria knows what happens after the glimmer in her eye
    sparks and she pushes up in her chair and begins tossing out ideas and connecting
    dots. The way Maria thinks is somewhere between a journalist, a moral philosopher,
    a web application designer, and a database architect. Two weeks ago we had a meeting
    with Maria and her team to discuss rolling out some journalism technology with
    her team. Within five minutes Maria has sprinted past what any of us had envisioned
    - basically laying out a roadmap for the reinvention of journalism in the age
    of messaging networks and on demand information services.  \n\nThere is something
    deep in the notion of social justice. It is  that there is a definable justice
    that sits beneath courts and laws, a justice that is 'social' in the sense that
    it is what society knows to be true. Maria has been fighting for social justice
    in the Philippines for decades by simply documenting the truth in that society.
    And now the powers that are threatened by that truth are corrupting their courts
    and laws to preserve their ability to control what can be said by whom. This is
    not only a threat to our dear friend Maria and her colleague Rey, it is more profoundly
    a threat to journalism *and* democracy in the Philippines and around the world.
    \n\n\nPlease join us in raising your voice in support. #holdtheline #standwithmaria
    #supportrappler \n\n---\n\n*Meedan's Check Global Network invites you to attend
    our upcoming online event on June 18: [Maria Ressa and Seema Yasmin in Conversation:

    [As we've seen](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/using-misinformation-as-a-political-weapon-covid-19-and-bolsonaro-in-brazil/), health misinformation is escalating not only within Western democracies but also at a dangerous scale in emerging economies, where independent media workers and organizations have had to wade through financial, physical, and mental strain. As the Check Global team continued to monitor the ramifications of COVID-19 on emerging economies and independent media organizations, the need to act was undeniable.

    Meedan has engaged in a company-wide effort to address our partners' challenges, whether through building new technologies[ such as the COVID-19 Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/), providing independent newsrooms and partners with [a database led by expert epidemiologists and public health workers](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/) to facilitate fact-checking and verification initiatives, or contributing to [global research](https://meedan.com/blog/global-misinfodemic-report/) about COVID-19-related misinformation. In the interest of reaching out to new organizations in need, the Check Global team announced on April 8 a call to [support media organizations and media workers in Asia-Pacific, in Africa, in Latin America and in the North Africa Western Asia region through a series of micro-grants.](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/) The microgrants projects ranged amongst fact-checking projects, media literacy campaigns and daily blogging reflecting on applicants' quarantine realities. We were blown away by the popularity of our call, receiving a whooping 298 applications in less than 30 days!

    While overwhelming and heartening, the large pool of applications made the selection process challenging. A few criteria guided us in this process. Originality and the innovative nature of the application were  important factors in the selection. Some applications stood out for their creativity and clarity. Applications were also shortlisted on the basis of their achievability --- projects that proposed activities and outputs that could be realistically achieved during the current health crisis were prioritised. Finally, outreach and potential impact were also important factors. Projects that strengthened the involvement of underserved communities and represented issues of people in areas outside the radar of mainstream media made it to the final selection process. We had limited funding, but there are many applications that are deserving, and we hope to be able to support those projects at a later stage.

    In this round, we awarded 24 projects with funding that ranged between $300 and $2,500, for a total of $47,000. From organisations involved in relief work around COVID-19 to individuals committed to tracking the impact of the pandemic on local communities, - the range of applications was wide, rich and diverse. Given the work they do, some of these grantees face risks of political repression, and we're not able to list all of them here. Here are some of the highlights from our work:

    ### APAC: 7 Fact-checking projects targeting vulnerable groups

    We received close to 40 applications from the Asia Pacific region.

    We selected seven applications for media work have been selected from the APAC region for the COVID-19 microgrants. These represent six countries in the region, with a particular focus on Southeast and South Asia --- Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. The creation of online content that is fact-checked and accurate has been an area around which a few groups have designed their projects. [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/) has designed a project to create an online information hub in order to provide fact-checked information to citizens and civil society organisations. In the Philippines, we are thrilled to support the work of an individual, Carol Dawonlay/[Lalang Hu Mga Laga](https://www.facebook.com/pg/storiesofwomencampaign/posts/) who will produce social media cards and videos to highlight violence against women during the pandemic. [BASAbali](https://basabali.org/) in Indonesia is in the process of designing a digital literacy campaign around COVID-19 with the underserved and minority communities in Bali.

    We're also happy to support [Disability Empowerment Society Nepal](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/); they have designed a project to create an accessible website to provide news and information on COVID-19 to people with disabilities. In India, [Sadbhavana Trust](http://sadbhavanatrust.org.in/) will strengthen the leadership and meaningful participation of young women from underserved communities in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak by creating online content from a feminist perspective. [International Youth Alliance for Peace](https://iyapsl.org/) in Sri Lanka will design a  blogging project to capture stories of frontline workers addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

    ### Africa: 6 efforts curbing the ramifications of the COVID-19 misinfodemic

    We were thrilled by the 170 applications we received from Africa, which made up the majority of our overall application pool. Due to our limited funds we were only able to support six  applications from Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, Guinee, Tanzania, Zambia. Here are highlights from four of these.

    [People's Check](http://www.peoplescheck.org/) in Nigeria is launching the 'Verify Nigeria' project to fact-check and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that has affected people's health and life in Nigeria. People's Check will create different visual elements and participate in training students and citizen journalists on health fact-checking training. [Radio Daljir SOMALIA](https://www.daljir.com/) will support media literacy efforts in Somalia and design audio campaigns and radio reporting to bring health facts to the public, encourage COVID-19 prevention measures & make social distancing possible. Radio Daljir will target communities in Somalia's regions of Puntland and Galmudug States of Somalia with a focus on the situation of the nomads. [Zéro Pauvre Afrique (ZPA, "Zero Poor in Africa")](https://www.facebook.com/zeropauvreenafrique/) will track, deconstruct, disseminate misinfodemics with support of a network of volunteers in order to reduce their impact on the management of the COVID-19 crisis in Guinea.

    Family Welfare Foundation's project will contribute to ensuring engagement of human rights defenders and activists with local artists in documenting, information sharing, reporting and amplifying voices on injustice issues, human rights abuse and repressions associated to COVID-19 interventions in Tanzania.

    We are building on the success of the COVID-19 microgrants to create different media funds in Africa that can support more innovative projects.

    ### Latin America: Sustaining the work of 5 women-led independent media organizations

    We received 47 applications from Latin America in both Spanish and Portuguese. The majority of the 7 selected initiatives are led by women and are covering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in their regions. [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/) will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets in Cuba ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)) to increase regional awareness in matters related to the pandemic. Another fact checking initiative [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/) agency works and specializes in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com) a group of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With the theme "From my window" [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas ](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.GDezza.net) and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.

    ### NAWA: Supporting 5 investigations and fact-checking initiatives
    As for applications from the North Africa Western Asia region, we were lucky to receive 24 applications, both in English and Arabic.

    We are pleased and excited to support five projects from the region, divided between media literacy campaigns, fact-checking initiatives and in-depth investigations. [Radio Medenine](http://radiomedenine.com/), a community radio project based in southern Tunisia, aims to create a digital health program interviewing health experts and providing pressing health information. Award-winning collaborative blog [Nawaat](http://nawaat.org/portail/) ("the core" in Arabic), also from Tunisia, will be sustaining its trilingual fact-checking efforts through our grant over the next month, while media platform [SyriaUntold](https://syriauntold.com/en/) will publish a series of investigative reports about health disparities in Syria. We were also happy to fund an investigation on the state of African refugees in Tangier and a health fact-checking campaign in Egypt.

    The above COVID-19 microgrants recipients have given Meedan consent to announce their projects publicly, while others have not been named for security reasons.

  body: "Today the health communications organization [Nigeria Health Watch](https://nigeriahealthwatch.com/)
    and Meedan announce a partnership to counter misinformation around COVID-19 and
    other public health challenges in Nigeria. This partnership will take place through
    Meedan's [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/). \n\nThe spread
    of misinformation during disease outbreaks is a global issue. False or misleading
    information around disease prevention, treatment and cures can can cause confusion
    and panic, and can be dangerous to public health. There is there an urgent need
    for collaboration to address widespread health misinformation as governments tackle
    the double epidemic of misinformation and COVID-19.\n\nThrough the partnership,
    potentially false or misleading COVID-19 claims will be identified, and Nigeria
    Health Watch will leverage Meedan’s [team of experts](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/about/)
    to produce multimedia messages that debunk misinformation around the virus. The
    multimedia messages will include critical context and background information that
    is key to safely communicating debunks to misinformation. The project will apply
    insights from collated data to create evidence-based media campaigns to counter
    COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nManaging Director at Nigeria Health Watch, Vivianne
    Ihekweazu, said “Misinformation poses a threat to the public response to outbreaks,
    eroding the public’s trust, and their willingness and ability to take preventative
    measures.\" \n\n“As we’re learning each day, information and misinformation about
    the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading in online ecosystems as rapidly as the virus
    itself is spreading around the world. Strained access to health experts during
    emergencies, such as the one we’re experiencing, can quickly lead to poor health
    outcomes, as low-quality information exacerbates the real-world spread of disease,”
    said Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab lead. \n\n#### About Nigeria Health

  body: "Today at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/), the largest worldwide
    gathering of fact-checkers, global technology not-for-profit Meedan announced
    a case study of a global fact-checking project using the [WhatsApp Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api).
    The groundbreaking study is based on nearly 5,700 fact-checks across India, Brazil,
    South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria and was made possible with support from WhatsApp
    and Facebook. \n\n<p class=\"text-align--center\">\n<a class=\"button no-margin\"

    the full report: End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nFor the project, Meedan
    developed several software features on [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check),
    a web application for journalists to verify and annotate online information for
    open-source investigations, that were customized specifically for global fact-checking
    organizations and deployed by the AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa Check, BOOM
    and India Today. They have  been running since October 2019 across 4 languages
    and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions today. \n\nThe
    report, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact),
    details the insights, field research and product features made that maximized
    the value of the API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference
    to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on the end-to-end encrypted
    service.   \n\n“Fact-checkers working globally have a variety of needs, so we
    built tools that optimize workflows and the nuances of AI in order to create a
    roadmap for improving fact-checking and information integrity across the web,”
    said Ed Bice, CEO, Meedan. “This effort has been highly collaborative, and we
    appreciate the support and guidance that we were given from the teams at AFP,
    Africa Check, BOOM and India Today in particular.”\n\nThe report offers the following
    core insights:\n\n#### Bots are the new audience engagement paradigm. \nA WhatsApp
    fact-Checking bot can serve three purposes: (1) help audiences understand how
    to interact with the fact-checking team and see commonly-requested content, (2)
    serve as a bridge between a human editor and someone submitting content to a tipline
    and (3) cut down on unactionable content.\n\n#### Machines in the loop augment
    quality human efforts.\nAlready designed for human work, Check now automates everything
    from content matching to intake, helping fact-checkers do their jobs more efficiently
    and therefore effectively.\n\n#### Follow the news cycle.\nNewsrooms learned that
    a topic-oriented approach to tipline promotion following the news cycle yields
    stronger audience engagement and submissions. After the outbreak of COVID-19,
    we saw an uptick in the percentage of quality, actionable content, in turn generating
    better fact-checks.\n\n#### Fact-checkers need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces
    in multiple languages.\nWe adapted our toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on
    the fact-checking rather rather than technical tasks. This enabled teams to customize
    their workflows.\n\n“We used to get inundated by the thousands of messages that
    people would send us on WhatsApp,” said Balkrishna, fact-checking editor at [India
    Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/). “Check has not only made it possible for us
    to sift through the fact-check requests quickly, it also helped deliver most of
    our readers with fast and personalized responses. This helps us build a direct
    bond of trust with our audience.” \n\n“Check really improved the way we communicate
    with our readers on WhatsApp,” said María Clara Pestre, a fact-checker at [AFP
    Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/) (Brazil). “Now, we can be sure anyone who
    reaches out through the app will have an immediate and consistent reply, while
    having time to dedicate ourselves to other parts of the verification process.”\n\n“We’re
    excited to work with partners like Meedan to help address the challenge of misinformation
    within private messaging. Our approach is to give users tools to easily get accurate
    information and support fact checking,” said Ben Supple, head of civic engagement
    at WhatsApp. “We appreciate and value the work done to maximize the WhatsApp Business
    API for fact checkers and ensure more people have access to accurate information
    at the click of a button.”\n\nMeedan presented this study at [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
    with representatives from WhatsApp, the International Fact Checking Network, Boom
    and Africa Check. See the video from the panel here:\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe

    Shalini Joshi moderates a discussion about the evolution of fact-checking on WhatsApp
    at Global Fact 7</p>\n\nTo support this work, Meedan developed a number of key
    software features that maximized the WhatsApp Business API with a mix of AI, interface
    and multilingual innovations, including:\n\n__Multilingual WhatsApp Bot:__ a customizable
    bot that presents both intuitive menu items and human conversations with fact-checkers
    in multiple languages\n\n__Workflow Automation:__ a triage system to recognize,
    review and prioritize claims and responses\n\n__Similarity Analysis:__ algorithms
    that detect content patterns and trends based on variations of the same claims\n\n__Response
    at Scale:__ a publishing system to send fact-check reports to tipline users who
    send duplicate or similar requests\n\n“Our goal with [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check),”
    explained Meedan’s Director of Product Pierre Conti, “is to build a scalable human
    and AI system for fact-checkers to efficiently size the demand for verification
    directly from their audience, cut through the noise, and maximize impact by helping
    them to prioritize their response to the most pressing misinformation.”"

    o maior encontro mundial de verificadores de fatos, a Meedan, uma organização
    de tecnologia, global e sem fins lucrativos, anunciou o estudo de caso de um projeto
    global de verificação de fatos, que utiliza a API Comercial do WhatsApp [WhatsApp
    Business API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api). Esse estudo inovador é baseado
    em quase 5.700 verificações de fatos na Índia, no Brasil, na África do Sul, no
    Quênia e na Nigéria, e foi possível graças ao apoio do WhatsApp e do Facebook.\n\n<p

    o Download do relatório completo (em inglês): End-to-End Fact-Checking</a>\n</p>\n\nPara
    realizar este projeto, a Meedan desenvolveu diversas funcionalidades no software
    [Check](https://www.meedan.com/check), um aplicativo web para jornalistas, utilizado
    para verificar e anotar informações on-line em investigações de código aberto.
    Elas foram projetadas especialmente para organizações globais de verificação de
    fatos e adotadas pela AFP (no Brasil e na Índia), Africa Check, BOOM e India Today.
    Essas novas funcionalidades estão sendo utilizadas desde outubro de 2019 em 4
    idiomas e mais de 180.000 mensagens foram submetidas, incluindo aqueles ainda
    em curso. O relatório, chamado [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan_Global-Fact_Whatsapp-Pilot-Case-Study.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)(Verificação
    de Fatos de Ponta-a-Ponta), detalha as descobertas, as pesquisas de campo realizadas
    e as funcionalidades de produto que maximizou o valor da API para verificadores
    de fatos em todo o mundo. O nome, Check, é uma referência à capacidade do programa
    de verificar fatos em um serviço criptografado de ponta-a-ponta, com resultados
    exitosos.\n\n“Verificadores de fatos trabalhando no mundo todo têm necessidades
    variadas, então criamos ferramentas que otimizam os fluxos de trabalho e as nuances
    da IA, a fim de criar um roteiro para melhorar a verificação de fatos e a integridade
    das informações na web”, disse Ed Bice, CEO da Meedan. “Esse esforço foi altamente
    colaborativo, e nós agradecemos o apoio e a orientação que recebemos, em particular
    das equipes da AFP, da Africa Check, da BOOM e da India Today.”\n\nO relatório
    apresenta as seguintes descobertas mais relevantes:\n\n#### Bots são o novo paradigma
    de relacionamento com o público. \n\nUm bot de Verificação de Fatos do WhatsApp
    pode ser utilizado com três propósitos: (1) ajudar o público a entender como interagir
    com a equipe de verificação de fatos e ter acesso ao conteúdo mais frequentemente
    solicitado; (2) servir como uma ponte entre um jornalista e alguém que envia conteúdo
    à um canal direto (tipline); e (3) reduzir o volume de conteúdo que não é relevante.\n\n####
    Máquinas semi-automatizadas aumentam a qualidade do trabalho humano.\nCheck ajuda
    verificadores de fatos a trabalharem de maneira mais eficiente e eficaz.\n\n####
    Seguir o ciclo das notícias.\nAs redações de jornais aprenderam que manter o foco
    em tópicos relevantes em seus contextos e seguir o ciclo de notícias, gera maior
    envolvimento de público e mais envios de informações. Após a eclosão da pandemia
    de COVID-19, vimos um aumento percentual em qualidade, em conteúdo útil, e, por
    sua vez, na geração de melhores verificações de fatos.\n\n#### Verificadores de
    fatos precisam de interfaces simples e em diversos idiomas.\nSem se preocupar
    com códigos de programação. Nós adaptamos nosso kit de ferramentas para ajudar
    verificadores de fatos a se concentrarem na verificação de fatos, e não em tarefas
    técnicas. Isso permitiu que as equipes criassem seus próprios fluxos de trabalho.\n\n“Costumávamos
    ficar sobrecarregados com as milhares de mensagens que as pessoas nos enviavam
    pelo WhatsApp”, disse Balkrishna, editor de verificação de fatos do[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/).
    “O Check não somente nos permitiu filtrar rapidamente as solicitações de verificação
    de fatos, mas também nos ajudou a oferecer respostas rápidas e individuais à maioria
    dos nossos leitores. Isso nos ajuda a criar um vínculo direto de confiança com
    nosso público. ”\n\n“O Check melhorou muito a maneira como nos comunicamos com
    nossa audiência no WhatsApp”, disse Maria Clara Pestre, verificadora de fatos
    da [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/)(Brasil). “Agora, podemos ter certeza
    de que qualquer pessoa que entrar em contato conosco por meio do aplicativo terá
    uma resposta imediata e coerente. Ao mesmo tempo, dispomos de tempo para nos dedicarmos
    às outras etapas do processo de verificação.”\n\n“Estamos entusiasmados em trabalhar
    com parceiros como a Meedan para ajudar a enfrentar o desafio da desinformação
    em mensagens privadas. A nossa intenção é oferecer aos usuários ferramentas para
    que eles acessem, de maneira fácil, informações precisas, e dar suporte à verificação
    de fatos”, disse Ben Supple, chefe de engajamento cívico do WhatsApp. \n\n“Agradecemos
    e valorizamos o trabalho realizado para maximizar o valor da API Comercial do
    WhatsApp (WhatsApp Business API) para verificadores de fatos e, assim, garantir
    que mais pessoas tenham acesso a informações precisas com o clique de um botão.”\n\nA
    Meedan apresentou este estudo no [Global Fact 7](https://virtual.globalfact7.com/),
    com representantes do WhatsApp, da International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN)
    - (Rede Internacional de Verificação de Fatos (IFCN), da Boom e da Africa Check.
    \n\nPara realizar este trabalho, a Meedan desenvolveu uma série de funcionalidades
    de software, que maximizou o valor da API Comercial do WhatsApp (WhatsApp Business
    API), usando uma mistura de inteligência artificial, interface e inovações multilíngues,
    que incluem:\n\n__Bot multilíngue do WhatsApp:__ um bot personalizável que apresenta
    itens de menu intuitivos e conversas com verificadores de fatos em vários idiomas;\n\n__Automação
    do fluxo de trabalho:__ um sistema de triagem para reconhecer, revisar e priorizar
    demandas e soluções;\n\n__Análise de similaridade:__ algoritmos que detectam padrões
    e tendências de conteúdo com base em variações das mesmas demandas de conteúdo;\n\n__Resposta
    em escala:__ um sistema de publicação para enviar relatórios de verificação de
    fatos aos usuários de canais diretos (tiplines) que enviarem solicitações duplicadas
    ou semelhantes.\n\n“Nosso objetivo com o [Check](http://www.meedan.com/check)”,
    explicou o Diretor de Produto da Meedan, Pierre Conti, “é construir um sistema
    humano e de IA para que os verificadores de fatos possam dimensionar com eficiência
    a demanda por verificação diretamente do público, cortar o que for apenas ruído
    e maximizar assim o impacto das verificações. Fazemos isso para ajudar os verificadores
    a priorizarem as desinformações mais relevantes.”"

  body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
    the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
    around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on the
    contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
    recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally false
    information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just  harmful
    for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality information
    also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to greater numbers
    of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing an MPH at the Harvard
    T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person raised in the American
    South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of the COVID-19 online informational
    arena. On the one hand, I have access to some of the highest-quality and timely
    information on the pandemic. On the other, I have a lens into American skepticism
    of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in which  public health authorities  (such
    as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO themselves), are not effectively reaching
    the general public, particularly in the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly
    challenging to regulate, often because it spreads  informally across a range of
    social media platforms. Evidence shows that traditional public health interventions
    on social media, which present text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for
    obtaining wide-reach. This becomes particularly clear when those interventions
    are compared to the reach of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge
    is the fact that news sources are often not staffed with in-house public health
    experts, and given that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that
    preclude a free-flowing stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn
    order to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19
    (SAC) and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
    are partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
    tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
    the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
    COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
    particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted alongside
    expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/) database
    for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has the potential
    for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and, in turn, improved
    public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

  body: "*This report was written by [Learning Lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/learning-lab/),
    a team of writers and designers to help  Open Technology Fund-supported projects
    produce content, and cross-posted at [the Open Technology Fund website](https://www.opentech.fund/news/stemming-the-spread-of-meme-based-disinformation/).*\n\nIn
    today’s increasingly online world, social media has become a source for news—often
    in compressed visual form. Widely circulated images have the power to shape opinions
    and alter actions. Sometimes they’re funny. Sometimes they’re informative. But
    what happens when memes are used to intentionally transmit disinformation (information
    that is false and deliberately created to cause harm)? How are people supposed
    to know what’s true and what’s false?\n \nIf the distinction seems trivial, it’s
    not. Elections and lives hang in the balance of finding a way to solve this problem
    in an efficient and effective manner. That’s why Meedan received funding from
    the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) (OTF) in 2019 to help develop
    the Claims and Memes Database (CMDb)—a programmer-accessible repository of fact-checked
    claims and debunked visual misinformation intended to combat this new type of
    information control. The CMDb project was overseen by Meedan program manager [Wafaa
    Heikal](https://meedan.com/blog/meet-our-regional-program-managers-apac-latin-america-and-africa/).
    \n \n \n#### SETTING THE STAGE\n### The rise of the intentional use of misinformation
    online\n \nMeedan has long worked at the forefront of improving the quality and
    equity of online information. One of the main ways it does so is through the organization’s
    flagship software, [Check](https://meedan.com/check). This free and [open-source](https://github.com/meedan/check)
    collaborative workflow software helps users verify digital photos and text, build
    datasets, and structure open-source investigations. An early iteration of the
    software played a key role for citizen journalists during the 2011 Arab Spring
    protests. Five years later, over 1,000 journalists used Check’s collaborative
    verification structure to help monitor and detect voting issues in the 2016 U.S.
    presidential election. Today, over 250 workspaces created by more than 1,750 users
    around the world now rely on Check to fact-check and investigate online information.
    Their efforts, and the stories they have helped produce, have made a tangible
    difference in the way global citizen media is relied upon and viewed.\n \nBut
    by 2019, with repressive regimes ramping up their own efforts to weaponize visual
    misinformation as a tool for social network manipulation, voter suppression, and
    censorship, it became clear that the Check platform required an upgrade. Journalists
    needed to be able to more efficiently verify or debunk memes. And citizens needed
    to be able to receive that fact-checked information in a more expeditious manner.
    So, with the funding from OTF’s Core Infrastructure Fund, Meedan set out to build
    the CMDb and enhance Check’s infrastructure.\n \n \n#### TRUE OR FALSE—EXPLAINED\n###
    Inside Meedan’s revolutionary verification software Check\n \nBefore diving into
    the details of the CMDb project, it’s best to understand how Check works.\n \nThe
    software helps journalists, researchers, and civil society organizations gather
    and verify digital information through a uniquely customizable process. After
    a Check team creates their project workspace, they set-up how they will receive
    submissions for verification. These submissions can be images, text, a combination
    of images and text (memes), or videos. For example in India, the Checkpoint project
    allowed for submissions by providing WhatsApp users with a phone number to which
    they could text rumors, claims, or memes for verification. Other submission processes
    include collaborating with local partners in North Africa and West Asia to crowdsource
    investigative evidence of human rights violations (to be sent to the [UC Berkeley
    Human Rights Investigations Lab)](https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab)
    or working with students and journalists to help monitor elections in Tunisia.\n
    \nOnce these submissions are uploaded to Check, the verification process begins.
    Throughout it all, Meedan works with partners to shape their tasks and workflows
    based on the project’s specific needs. During verification, users (such as journalists
    or human rights researchers) review a submission and work to determine the claim’s
    origin and accuracy. Annotation options allow reviewers to provide in-depth analysis
    and tags. After all tasks are completed for a submission, a verdict is determined
    (these are customizable and often include correct, incorrect, or misleading).
    In certain situations, this verdict can then be transmitted back to the individual
    who submitted the claim.\n \n \n#### ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY\n### CMDb developments
    streamline the verification process for thousands of Check users\n \nEven just
    a brief overview of the verification process reveals how incredibly time-consuming
    it can be. With thousands of claims being submitted to election-monitoring projects,
    how can reviewers possibly verify each one?\n \nShort answer: They can’t. And
    the reviewers can’t provide the results fast enough to combat voter suppression
    and protect electoral integrity. But there is a way to streamline the process—that’s
    why Meedan applied to OTF to develop the CMDb.\n \nThe technology built for the
    CMDb allowed Meedan to develop better workflows for annotating claims and images
    on Check. These developments will help improve research and machine-learning processes
    in both the short and long term. OTF’s funding also allowed the Meedan team to
    build new features to better respond to memetic misinformation—like Check’s report
    designer, which enables journalists to quickly develop compelling visual responses
    to help stem the spread of misinformation online. New tools for processing content,
    like importing spreadsheets and ingesting content submitted from closed networks,
    were also developed with the support.\n \nIn addition to enhancing user ease,
    the CMDb project significantly improved Meedan’s image and claim similarity infrastructure.
    The newly developed claim/image matching technology enables similar images and
    claims to be clustered—making a verifier’s work far easier. By identifying secondary
    items that are related to a submitted claim, this matching technology allows for
    similar images and memes to automatically receive the same tagging, annotation,
    and verdict as the original image or meme. This technological advancement produced
    immediate efficiencies. Journalists are now able to cluster hundreds of similar
    images and claims and respond to misinformation in a collective manner (saving
    massive amounts of time and effort).\n \n \n#### EXPANDED OUTREACH\n### Immediate
    application of CMDb technology and OTF funds enable Meedan to expand its global
    impact\n \nMeedan quickly put the newly developed CMDb technology to use. The
    streamlined content workflows and image matching technology helped support dozens
    of newsrooms and fact-checking organizations during the 2019 elections in India,
    Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n \n__India__: In response to misinformation circulating
    in closed networks in India, Meedan partnered with [Pop-Up Newsroom](https://popup.news/),
    WhatsApp, and [Proto](https://www.pro.to/) (a civic media studio) on the massive
    and innovative research endeavor, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/).
    The effort used Check Message, Meedan’s WhatsApp integration, to conduct research
    to better understand the ways by which misinformation spreads on WhatsApp.\n \n__Indonesia__:
    [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) worked in collaboration
    with Meedan and the news consultancy [Fathm](https://www.fathm.co/) to help journalism
    schools, newsrooms, and fact-checking organizations in Indonesia collaborate and
    verify claims during and leading up to the 2019 elections. The initiative, which
    resembled [Meedan’s 2016 Electionland effort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhD379ggq54&feature=emb_title)
    in the United States, was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta.\n \n__Philippines__:
    Meedan teamed up with local partners in the Philippines to create [Tsek.ph](https://tsek.ph/)—a
    new collaborative fact-checking journalistic initiative (Tsek means “Check” in
    Filipino). The project brought together 11 news organizations and three universities
    in an effort to counter disinformation and provide verified information related
    to the country’s midterm elections. Throughout the year, Meedan also continued
    its work with VeraFiles and Rappler, two pioneers of fact-checking and verification
    in the Philippines.\n \nSupport from OTF in 2019 also enabled Meedan to lead various
    informational workshops around the globe showcasing the CMDb project and providing
    journalists with a better understanding of the power—for good, and for bad—of
    global memes and claims. Various aspects of the CMDb’s research were presented
    by Meedan's Director of Research, Scott Hale, at the International Multimodal
    Communication Centre, University of Oxford, the Okinawa Institute for Science
    and Technology, and the CCSS School on Computational Social Science at the University
    of Kobe. \n\nMeedan’s Director of Engineering, Caio Almeida, [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Bs713r-i-lAPj6uPwqreX8QvNQ0EW_TnoEuN3dF6V0/edit#slide=id.p)
    a research paper, [Text Similarity Using Word Embeddings to Classify Fake News](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2607/short4.pdf),
    at the [Workshop on Digital Humanities and Natural Language Processing](https://propor.di.uevora.pt/)
    collocated with the International Conference on the Computational Processing of
    Portuguese (PROPOR 2020). The paper describes the new, open-source architecture
    Meedan developed to use word embeddings at scale with Elasticsearch in order to
    analyse the similarity of short textual items and identify near duplicates. A
    second research paper evaluating the text and image matching performance is currently
    in preparation.\n \nWhile contributing to research efforts, Meedan also provided
    input to Facebook, Twitter, and Google regarding the best approaches to the use
    of misleading manipulated and synthetic imagery on social media platforms. This
    feedback was taken into consideration when Twitter drafted new guidelines on manipulated
    media. Additionally, as part of the [W3C Credible Web Community Group](https://credweb.org/),
    Meedan contributed to the development of a list of indicators for content credibility,
    including images. And, as part of the [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/),
    members of Meedan helped form the Responding to Memes and Images working group
    to further address credibility indicators for images and memes.\n \n \n#### DATA
    DRAWBACKS\n### Complications emerge surrounding data sharing and sensitivity\n
    \nDespite the significant progress achieved during the CMDb’s first year, the
    project was not without its difficulties. Obstacles arose pertaining to the data
    collected by partners using Check’s software. Ideally, the images and claims that
    comprise the CMDb would be able to be shared publicly. But doing so creates a
    host of ethical concerns and legal issues regarding terms of service, varying
    privacy policies, and the very real threat of revealing personal information.
    Meedan worked with Harvard Law School’s [Cyberlaw Clinic](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/clinical/clinics/cyberlaw-clinic/)
    on terms that enable us to conduct research on this data while protecting personally
    identifiable information and user privacy. Options such as data trusts, in which
    a legally separate trust would own the underlying data, are also being explored.
    These efforts are critical, as finding a way to make the database accessible to
    other users—and one day even the general public—would help further curb the spread
    of misinformation online.\n \nAnother obstacle that emerged during the project
    was psychological. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the investigations conducted
    using Check, images can be highly graphic and therefore traumatizing for people
    to review. At this time, image and text matching technology can only reduce—not
    eliminate—the need for human judgement. That means in cases of human rights violations,
    an individual must still personally view the submitted image. Such work involves
    serious mental health challenges and risks like PTSD. Meedan is working to better
    understand these problems and provide the necessary resources to support the journalists
    and fact-checkers in these roles. Although new developments, like the option to
    flag and filter unwanted images, provide possible mitigation options—this issue
    needs more attention and may not be able to be solved by technology alone.\n \n
    \n#### LOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n### What’s next for Meedan, Check, and the CMDb?\n
    \nMeedan’s work to build a publicly accessible global claims and memes database
    is far from over. Data sharing issues must be resolved, language barriers must
    be overcome, and the matching technology must continue to be improved. Nonetheless,
    the first year of the CMDb project was a resounding success. Technology developed
    for the project is already in use, saving critical time and effort for journalists
    and human rights activists in the verification process. Much was also learned
    about the ways by which disinformation spreads across the internet. In response,
    an infrastructure was established that one day will be able to prevent debunked
    claims and memes from traveling across countries and time (known as “zombie misinformation,”
    these false rumors originate in one context and continue to permeate the internet
    despite being “killed off”—debunked—in their original country/time).\n \nFor now,
    Meedan has focused its efforts on combating the spread of misinformation related
    to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like the virus itself, misinformation pertaining to
    “cures” or “treatments” is spreading around the world and causing real harm. Meedan
    is committed to making its full toolkit and code available to help improve trust,
    information quality, and research capabilities. The organization’s development
    of the CMDb, and its history of fighting to advance accurate information online,
    make it uniquely positioned to help during this critical time. As a critical first
    step, Meedan introduced the [Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/)—a
    customizable COVID-19 WhatsApp bot for fact-checkers tackling the wave of misinformation
    surrounding the virus.  The [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
    which contains a database of expert-sourced COVID-19 information, has been built
    to help support verification processes.\n \nNow, as repressive regimes continue
    to expand their use of misinformation online, and COVID-19 rumors threaten to
    wreak havoc on public health, Meedan’s work is more important than ever. Memes
    are no longer a laughing matter. Lives truly hang in the balance of determining
    what’s true and what’s false."

    \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot of
    people.’\") that the worst was yet to come. In the past few months, the pandemic
    has hit emerging economies with dense urban populations in which social distancing
    and isolation are impossibilities. \n\nLatin America's societies have seen the
    horror of [bodies piling](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bodies-piled-ecuador-covid-19-hotspot-200617142117507.html

    of Ecuador, among the dead those of at least [9 journalists](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/los-riesgos-de-cubrir-la-pandemia-en-ecuador-fad831054013
    \"Los riesgos de cubrir la pandemia en Ecuador\") that died because of lack of
    protection equipment during work. At the same time, Brazil now has the [second
    highest ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html \"COVID-19 Johns Hopkins Dashboard\")
    death toll in the world, and the favelas population are left to their own luck
    while [self-organizing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html
    \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot of
    people.’\") to fight against the virus. \n\nThe pandemic arrives in a context
    that according to the [2019 Reporters Without Borders Index](https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-freedom-index-cycle-fear
    \"2019 World Press Freedom Index – A cycle of fear \"), has seen in the last years
    a surge in corruption, increasingly concentrated media ownership and violence
    against journalists. This has contributed to a spike in fear and self-censorship,
    state censorship and authoritarian excesses, disinformation and cyber-harassment.\n\nMedia
    concentration turned historically family-owned companies into conglomerates. [UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421
    \"Unesco\") has warned about the threats of this process: when combined with property
    concentration, geographic concentration also affects pluralism and diversity,
    as it generates a uniformity of agendas and informational contents. Concentration
    is perceived as ‘indirect censorship’ by international and supranational organisations
    such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n\nA form of media ecosystem
    response to this oppressive scenario is the emerging number of independent media
    outlets. A great example is in the Northern Triangle where [independent media](https://niemanreports.org/articles/how-independent-journalists-in-latin-america-are-finding-new-ways-to-hold-power-to-account/
    \"How Independent Journalists in Latin America are Finding New Ways to Hold Power
    to Account\") has been on the rise as well as in most of Latin America. [Public
    interest](http://waccglobal.org/articles/a-new-wave-of-public-service-journalism-in-latin-america
    \"A new wave of public service journalism in Latin America\") journalism is trying
    to make governments accountable to their oppressions and mistakes. \n\nIn 2021
    we aim to expand our support to new partners initiatives in these regions of Latin
    America, such as the Northern Triangle (Honduras, Salvador and Guatemala) that
    in the last decade have seen violence escalate since a wave of street gang members

    This and years of unrest has [started waves of migration ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/central-americas-turbulent-northern-triangle
    \"Central America’s Turbulent Northern Triangle\") that have resulted in millions
    of people seeking better living conditions. For an example, see the work of Chicas

    their flagship event to an online format, creating their first Online Mediathon
    in Ecuador that is scheduled to happen at the end of 2020 , in which 100 women
    will be trained in journalism and media skills. \n\nThey have also launched  [\"Women,
    Power and the Media\"](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/JC/mujerpoderymedios.html)
    a MOOC with attendees numbering as high as 3,900 women and increasing everyday,
    with support from Check Global and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/)
    and hosted by the [Knight Center](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/). The online
    course has been designed for women who work in the media and journalism field
    so they can strengthen their current leadership tools, acquire new ones and learn
    from the professional practices of other women leaders. The community that is
    organically being formed around it created job boards to share opportunities,
    study groups for LGBTQIA+ members in Guatemala and journalists that work with
    gender issues. This course will be translated to arabic and localized to the [NAWA
    Media](https://nawamedia.org/) website an open-access platform aimed at media
    professionals and journalism students in North Africa and Western Asia (NAWA)
    offering them support through training resources. \n \nAnother response to the
    pandemic was [Conversaciones Poderosas: COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHhWDKq8tA7U9BMlCkHA7uLSCo0gCMEga)
    (Powerful Conversations) a series of 8 facilitated conversations between media
    professionals published on the Chicas Poderosas YouTube channel, an initiative
    aimed to support Spanish-speaking journalists covering COVID–19.\n\nUnderstanding
    that women in Latin America have long been denied agency in healthcare and that
    this new virus is one of several health concerns, the project _Hermanas [Sisters]:
    Information to accelerate women's health_ was created to transform medical information
    and studies into accessible, attractive, and high-impact content, providing clear,
    verified information that will normalize prevention behaviors and question stereotypes.
    This will be shared under a Creative Commons license so it can be localized, translated
    and applied to other contexts.\n\n![Animal Politico: Supporting journalism innovation

    journalism innovation during a pandemic\n\nThe elections in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela,
    Paraguay, Colombia and El Salvador prompted an increase in attacks on journalists,
    especially by politicians, government officials and cyber-activists, and reinforced
    a climate of mistrust and animosity towards the media. Journalists are frequent
    [targets of death threats](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-19955-wave-threats-journalists-colombia-scares-and-awakens-memory-years-violence-against-pre),
    physical violence, and abduction.\n\n[Animal Politico](https://www.animalpolitico.com/),
    our Check Global partner based in Mexico, suffered cyber attacks in 2019 as a
    result of the independent work they do in what [Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/countries-cracked-down-on-asylum-and-the-right-to-protest-in-the-americas-in-2019/)
    has called one of the world’s deadliest countries to journalists. This year we
    are supporting them to continue their fact-checking work and research in social
    media to understand how disinformation that appears to be inoffensive is often
    focused on promoting hate speech and gender issues. They in turn are creating
    media literacy content in multimedia formats to access new and young audiences.\n\n![COVID-19

    COVID-19 Micro-grants: Support for women-led grassroots organizations\n\nBeyond
    our existing partners, Check Global has been keen to support a broader range of
    organizations. This year, we launched [25 micro-grants](https://meedan.com/blog/25-grassroots-projects-awarded-through-the-check-global-covid-19-fund/)
    to support independent grassroots organisations. Amongst them, we supported 7
    organizations in Latin America. One such group is [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/)(Collective
    Cirandeiras), who will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders
    in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be supporting
    the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets in Cuba
    [Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) (Journalism of the
    Barrio) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/) (The Touch) to increase regional awareness
    in matters related to the pandemic. \n\nAnother fact-checking initiative [Eté
    Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/)(Eté Fact-Checking) works and specializes
    in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population
    in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com)(Ruda Collective) a group
    of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the impact
    that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With the theme
    “From my window” [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/)
    (Mulherias Collective) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in
    the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador we
    will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)
    develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community
    in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in
    El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.gdezza.net)
    and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.\n             \nMeedan
    has experience running projects of [open-source investigations](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/27/help_bellingca_and_tbij_investigate_airstrikes/),
    collaborative journalism and [innovation](https://meedan.com/blog/how-meedan-supported-three-reporting-initiatives-in-asia/).
    Bringing this knowledge to grassroot organizations and adding them to the Check
    Global network brings possibilities of collaboration and building better products
    by having these organizations use our [open source software Check](https://meedan.com/check)
    in new ways, while tapping into the broader Check Global network initiatives,
    such as our network training calls and webinars, and potentially accessing expert-sourced
    information from our [COVID-19 Expert Database.](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)\n\n###
    Datos desaparecidos: memory as resistance \n\nThe rise of [conservative](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/16/the-trumpification-of-the-latin-american-right/),
    oppressive and misogynist governments in the region has led to a [spike in feminist
    activism](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/oppressive-sexist-policies-galvanize-bold-fight-for-womens-rights-in-2018/)
    and women jornalists uniting in [public manifestations](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21674-latin-american-women-journalists-march-equal-rights-and-against-gender-violence)
    in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, México, Chile and Brazil to advocate for
    human rights. These democratic activities led by activists, protesters and civil
    societies have been brutally shut down by governments. According to Amnesty International,
    these actions have resulted in the [death of 210](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/)
    people involved in protests. \n\nIn this digital age, memory is now born digitally,
    disseminated by activists and underrepresented communities in private platforms
    such as Facebook and Instagram. In 1973, the government of Argentina began disappearing
    people as a form of oppression, a practice that continues today in a number of
    Latin American countries under the frightful neologism of *desaparecidos*, or
    “the disappeared.” Today, we also struggle with *datos desaparecidos*, or disappeared
    data. Memory is a living thing and as a social practice it changes in each interaction,
    each time it is recalled. By preserving digital activism media and freedom of
    expression is a way to preserve integrity of these narratives.  It is important
    to safekeep these digital archives and memories from private company servers and
    interests. Open source technology can serve as an alternative. \n\nOur work in
    this discussion is facilitating and organizing community initiatives to address
    this issue, during events such as RightsCon 2020 and [Internet Freedom Glitter
    Meetup](https://meedan.com/events/internet-freedom-festival-glitter-meetup-recordkeepers-of-the-resistance/).
    We hope to open and share knowledge with intersectional feminist and freedom of
    expression communities and worldwide on how to safekeep historical records as
    the world fights a pandemic. We invite you to attend these events in our efforts
    to develop memory as a form of resistance.\n\nYou can read a bit more on [how
    memory has been erased during COVID-19 in Brazil](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-in-brazil-memory-as-a-form-of-resistance/)
    and the role that open source technology can have on safekeeping it.\n\n### Media
    Literacy: supporting media education to fight the misinfodemic \n\nThe region
    is seeing [a rise](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/nao-houve-ditadura-teve-uns-probleminhas-diz-bolsonaro-sobre-regime-militar-no-pais.shtml)
    in scientific and history [negationism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/03/denialism-what-drives-people-to-reject-the-truth)
    propagated by these governments, resulting in actions that will affect millions
    of people in the following years, focused on weakening the education system by
    diminishing the research budget in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/31/students-protest-across-brazil-over-jair-bolsonaros-sweeping-cuts-to-education)
    and [Argentina](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/thousands-scientists-argentina-strike-protest-budget-cuts),
    while in [Chile](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47525165) the system is failing
    the population. There has been an increase in [media education](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-20805-independent-media-northern-triangle-are-strengthened-do-data-journalism-limited-resour)
    and training initiatives as a response to the [misinformation](https://aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-foi-o-mais-citado-em-desinformacao-checada-no-facebook-em-2019/)
    platform that these governments have chosen to run. Media literacy in Brazil is
    now a [subject](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/educacao/noticia/2019-02/educacao-midiatica-forma-cidadao-consciente-dizem-especialistas)
    that will be added to the mandatory curriculum of schools.\n\nEducation is a strategy
    to [fight misinformation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421)
    and prevent future societal situations as the one we are living by training future
    journalists and university students in understanding media work. We can train
    teachers on how to do this inside Check and using our resources. It can be used
    to expand product applicability by creating workflows inside Check designed specifically
    for this purpose. This would be a key asset for future partnerships with universities,
    communities and educational institutes. If you are interested in this opportunity,
    please get in touch. We have the Check U programme, with a 10-module curriculum
    designed specifically for health misinformation that can be implemented by schools,
    and we are keen to partner with a local educator to ensure these resources are
    translated and localized to Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n### What's next for Check
    Global\n\nThe situation in Latin America continues to present numerous challenges
    that COVID-19 exacerbates and that will have lasting effects long after the pandemic
    is over. Our work at Meedan is to continue the support of our partners' impact
    during this time and to expand the access to information in the region. To achieve
    this, we will build on shared knowledge from our Check Global network and communities
    in NAWA, Asia Pacific and Africa. They have unifying health and political aspects
    during this pandemic, share colonial contexts, face similar issues and are crafting
    their own solutions as they lead the pathway to a more equitable internet and
    future."

    Free flow of reliable and independent information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However, with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people have limited access to independent information, and few spaces to dialogue and discuss the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain the pandemic. This challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly complex and evolving information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers are expected to distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious disease.

    People need news and information they can trust. Instead of making this available, governments are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information and scrutinizing voices that seek accountability.

    In order to analyze and discuss potential solutions to the current misinfodemic, Meedan hosted an online event on June 18, 2020 entitled, ‘Reporting Barriers During COVID-19. The session had veteran journalist and co-founder of Rappler, [Maria Ressa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Ressa) in conversation with [Dima Saber](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/-centres-of-excellence/centre-for-media-and-culture-studies/our-people/dima-saber), Meedan's Director of Check Global Program and Impact.

    The [2020 version of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference](https://acl2020.org/), originally planned to take place in Seattle, happened virtually from July 5th to 10th. This year's ACL, which is among the top publication venues for natural language processing researchers around the world, set many records as it was the first ACL event to ever be held virtually and had record numbers in volunteers, participants (overall and across continents) and accepted papers.

    ACL 2020 featured many papers addressing challenges in misinformation, fact-checking and computational journalism, with Microsoft Research Asia having three automated fact-checking papers in the main conference alone. Overall, most of these papers introduced new and important challenges to the community and some proposed new models to solve or improve on existing tasks. Throughout the rest of this blog post, I'll try to highlight some of these efforts.

    ### Main Conference Papers

    This year, there were a number of papers addressing misinformation and fact-checking from an NLP perspective. Here are some of the papers that caught my attention:

    #### [That is a Known Lie: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.332.pdf)

    The paper by [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about) (QCRI) team led by [Preslav Nakov](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/staff/dr-preslav-nakov), addresses the claim matching problem which [has been of interest to Meedan](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/videos/countering-the-covid-19-misinfodemic-with-text-similarity-and-social-data-science/) and the fact-checking community. Technology is needed to meet the ever-increasing volume of claims coming in to fact-checkers around the globe. One important and effective solution to this problem is the detection of duplicate and previously fact-checked claims. This paper presents two claim-matching datasets and proposes a mix of information retrieval and text embedding based models as potential solutions for the claim-matching problem.

    #### [Generating Fact Checking Explanations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.656.pdf)

    Extracting supporting evidence from discussions around a claim is the premise of this paper by [Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/)'s group at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). Using a dataset of facts from Politifact, the authors derive explanations using a BERT-based sentence selection model for each fact-checked statement. They show that the extracted explanations can help automated fact-checking models improve on veracity prediction tasks by jointly learning to do both fact-checking and explanation extraction.

    #### [DeSePtion: Dual Sequence Prediction and Adversarial Examples for Improved Fact-Checking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.761.pdf) 

    Work by authors from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) and [George Washington University](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/) provides resources and models for studying and understanding challenges in automated fact-checking. They address three types of challenges that confuse current automated fact-verification systems: multiple propositions (the need to synthesize evidence from various sources), temporal reasoning, and ambiguity and lexical variation. Their solutions largely use pointer networks, BERT and reinforcement learning algorithms. The code and resource of this extensive work is [publicly available](https://github.com/chridey/fever2-columbia).

    #### [Masking Actor Information Leads to Fairer Political Claims Detection](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.404.pdf)

    This is a short paper on identifying political claims from text that proposes a method for increasing fairness to minority groups in these models. The simple but useful reference masking method presented by University of Stuttgart researchers on a German newspaper dataset shows claim-detection models can be fairer to minorities without significant performance drops.

    #### [Prta: A System to Support the Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the News](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.32.pdf)

    This demonstration paper by QCRI won an honorable mention award in the demo category. The paper builds on top of their prior work on propaganda analysis and provides statistics on different propaganda techniques used in media outlets.

    ### Workshops

    Often mini-conferences of their own, workshops at ACL maintain high quality proceedings and hold fascinating invited talks. The line up for workshops this year included a variety of topics ranging from neural text generation and translation to educational applications and conversational AI. In the remainder of this post, I try to summarize the workshops I found interesting and relevant to computational journalism.

    #### [FEVER Workshop](https://fever.ai/workshop.html)

    The recent meeting of the workshop for fact extraction and verification included an excellent line-up of invited speakers and contributed work. This was the third edition of the excellent workshop organized by [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/), [James Thorne](https://jamesthorne.co.uk/), [Oana Cocarascu](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~oc511/), [Christos Christodoulopoulos](http://christos-c.com/) and [Arpit Mittal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fDORjGoAAAAJ&hl=en). The opening talk by [Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/) on the importance of explainable fact-checking first took a deep dive into extracting supporting evidence for fact veracity and then moved on to presenting work on claim understanding and what needs to be fact-checked. The overall sentiment within participants and speakers, as reiterated by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), was that we need more evidence-based and explanatory approaches in FEVER. Among other fascinating talks, [Philip Resnik](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) presented work on framing and how it affects our perception of news and facts. Through years of research on language framing, he portrayed that harmful content isn't always false information and sometimes more harm can be done with true information framed to serve a purpose. In his closing remarks, he called for a more "FEVER"ish approach to tackling our misinformation problems, meaning that we should go beyond labeling content fake or true and look at more complicated analyses of the phenomenon.

    #### [NLP COVID-19 Workshop](https://www.nlpcovid19workshop.org/)

    This ACL workshop was formed as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a short timeframe and contained many interesting peer-reviewed COVID-related papers, including research by NYU and University of Waterloo on [Rapidly Deploying a Neural Search Engine for the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset: Preliminary Thoughts and Lessons Learned](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PlUA_mgGaPq). This system and paper provided a neural search engine for COVID-19 literature and is available at [covidex.ai](http://covidex.ai/). With the large number of submissions in such short timelines, the workshop deserves a closer look at its proceedings.

    You can find the [full list of submitted papers here](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2020/Workshop/NLP-COVID).

    ### Final Thoughts

    With uncertainty caused by the pandemic and upcoming elections, it's both overwhelming and exciting to be involved in computational journalism research. It is refreshing to see the rapid community response to the pandemic and the evolution of computational misinformation research.

    Presented research on misinformation and fact-checking at ACL 2020 seems to be moving away from "automatic" misinformation detection towards addressing specific questions more in demand of journalists and fact-checkers. Acknowledging that any potential solution to the current misinformation problems will require more than just "detection", the shift in focus in this year's papers portrays the NLP community's maturity in understanding the deeper, more important underlying requirements for a working solution. Meedan has long advocated for an approach that augments and empowers human fact-checkers and does not try to replace them, an orientation that is evident in our [open-source fact-checking software, Check](https://meedan.com/check). There are many ways that NLP can assist fact-checkers, and even papers at ACL not specifically about misinformation such as text similarity, summarization, and cross-lingual alignment are relevant to tasks fact-checkers need to perform.

    This community growth could not have been possible without interdisciplinary collaborations and publication venues with journalism experts and researchers. As brought up both during and in their followup questionnaire, the FEVER workshop was interested in community feedback on future direction and next steps. Building on top of the fruitful interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for a future plan, now seems like a good time for a stronger NLP and journalism alliance in planning our next moves against information disorders.

  body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
    message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
    do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to begin
    with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups. The messages
    range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring you to forward
    messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary alignments.\n \nWhat
    followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate thread containing
    false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended to boost the sales of
    Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The forwarded text falsely
    claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated effort at the highest
    levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with
    “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars in profits at the cost
    of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular conspiracy theory
    was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly spread through
    WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists are battling
    misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
    In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem may be trickier to catch—and
    harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads predominantly in closed chat
    groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content moderators and fact-checkers.
    \ Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one I received recently are dangerous
    under normal circumstances, and downright deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation
    makes it harder for healthcare authorities to effectively communicate critical
    health information to wider audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows
    distrust in healthcare institutions and encourages disregard for basic public
    health advice. Often disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent
    Indian doctor advising viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated
    over 5,000 times on Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian
    doctors and frontline healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This
    is especially important in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate
    information spreads rapidly on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace,
    isolate, and care for COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread
    of COVID-19 have been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and
    misinformation has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular
    message circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s
    Press Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government
    was spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
    Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
    misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating on
    social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government. Get
    your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old rumors
    about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to promote vaccine
    hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual implementation
    of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine vaccinations for
    myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic is not limited
    to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous cow has been elevated
    to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow urine, have been marketed
    as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus. Such claims may have gained
    legitimacy under the current Government, which created an open call for research
    & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific treatments such
    as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year. In such circumstances,
    it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science from pseudoscience in a
    pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel even faster than COVID-19
    in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals were arrested for spreading
    a fictitious and official-sounding directive from state officials, asking local
    citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at once. Similar arrests have taken
    place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian states. Successive state governments
    have responded to misinformation by conducting mass arrests rather than tackling
    the problem at its root by improving health communication in localized languages.\n
    \nEffective health communication in a pandemic requires systematic investments
    in health infrastructure and adequate training for academics and journalists.
    Fortunately, many organizations are meeting this gap and providing resources and
    responses to tackle such misinformation. Organizations such as SciLine, the International
    Fact Checking Network (IFCN), and COVID Explained have developed several resources,
    unpacking claims about COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation
    related to COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation
    specifically, and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety
    of different languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity
    of evidence-based information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp
    users to effectively unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda
    or the marketing of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n
    \nIndia has detected 1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according
    to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active
    surveillance in India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher.
    Even if official estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation
    threatens to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development
    of a future vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize
    effective health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation,
    especially as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit

  body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled arm,
    a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit,
    changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical procedures
    like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage of the
    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
    Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
    came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
    of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
    in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
    mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities that
    are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through high-level
    decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with disabilities
    are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement
    on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and
    the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. Yet there is much
    more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access, and people with disabilities
    are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n-
    People with disabilities are at a higher risk of severe symptoms and death from
    COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
    found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
    and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
    of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
    Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
    on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
    L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
    is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
    living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
    for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than 1%
    of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable deaths
    are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n- People
    with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online during the
    COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment to essential
    services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
    about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
    like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
    internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
    [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
    [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
    [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
    and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
    with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
    face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
    and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see, hear,
    and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical abilities
    to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using one hand supplemented
    with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial than ever to mitigate barriers
    like these during a pandemic, where online access to quality information and essential
    activities can directly influence health outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital
    Health Lab is working to address “viral misinformation that facilitates the spread
    of a particular health outcome or disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing
    access to expert-sourced information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase
    access include avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public,
    providing a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating
    information for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse
    media channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
    Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion of
    humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
    people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
    making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
    under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
    We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
    and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
    justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
    information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
    join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

  body: |-
    As the world slowly starts to open up (or not), we've entered a new pandemic stage: confusion. Where once the most solid advice was simply to stay indoors and avoid others, we seem to be encountering a panoply of recommendations. Wash your hands. Masks aren't needed. Wear a mask. Stay six feet away. Actually, it might be airborne, so stay outside too. Take a test. Don't take a test, because supplies are limited.

    In the world of public health, this liminal stage we find ourselves in --- moving past lockdown but nowhere near reaching either a social or medical endpoint to the pandemic --- is often the most dangerous for a disease's spread. In 1918, the city of San Francisco had the fewest reported cases of Spanish Flu in the country thanks to strict social distancing practices. The city and the people declared victory, emerged from lockdown, and returned to normal life. By the end of the year, the city had one of the worst infection and mortality rates in the US, [with 45,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/san-francisco-had-1918-flu-under-control-then-it-lifted-n1191141).

    In the world of information trust, this liminal stage presents another threat: epistemic ambiguity. The usual model for misleading information is two fold: there's misinformation --- false information spread unintentionally --- and disinformation --- false information spread with the intent of harm. We've certainly seen this with COVID-19. [Misinfodemics](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), the spread of false information that exacerbates the spread of disease, have erupted around [drinking bleach](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/americans-are-drinking-bleach-and-dunking-food-in-it-to-prevent-covid-19/) or [methanol](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/iran-700-dead-drinking-alcohol-cure-coronavirus-200427163529629.html), having immunity [based on race](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/no-black-people-aren-t-immune-to-covid-19), and countless other bits of misinformation, leading to hospitalizations and even deaths.

    From a fact-checking perspective, this is relatively straightforward. Health professionals *know* bleach and methanol don't cure COVID-19. But the problem is in the murky areas, when fact-checking is being done in good faith but the extant body of knowledge is limited and evolving.

    Take an example from this summer. In June, an official from the World Health Organization COVID-19 [caused significant public confusion](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/) by saying that asymptomatic spread of novel coronavirus is rare. [As Poynter's Al Tompkins wrote](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/), this statement could "light new fires among people who believe the entire COVID-19 pandemic has been overblown and that there was no need for stay-at-home orders that keep seemingly healthy people at home." The next day, the WHO issued a clarification: the researcher was referring to emergent data from a small set of studies.

    So much more is being learned about the virus. We don't know right now if [people can be reinfected or not](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/can-someone-get-reinfected-and-get-covid-19-a-second-time/#undefined). Experts are debating whether [there's airborne transmission](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02058-1). We're still learning about [the role of vitamins](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/does-vitamin-d-help-prevent-or-treat-covid-19/). And it's not just that we don't know --- it's that no one knows. Science hasn't caught up yet. Do we wear a mask or not wear a mask? It's obvious now that we should, but just a few months ago, even respected bodies like the WHO and CDC were [offering conflicting advice](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-offer-conflicting-advice-masks-expert-tells-us/story?id=70958380).

    It turns out that the framework of mis- and disinformation has a basic assumption that doesn't always apply in the case of COVID-19: the idea that there might be a ground truth, somewhere, at some point, that someone might have in some situation. [As I've written before](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/12/the-death-of-consensus-not-the-death-of-truth/), the process of consensus-making requires a negotiation of truth through trusted parties and sources (and therefore subject to the rules of trust, emotion and relatability).

    But what if the information we're trying to discuss isn't known by anyone?


    ## Midinformation: When knowledge stands in the middle, what do we do?

    In the case of emerging knowledge, it might be helpful to think not just about misinformation but *mid*information. We know a little now, we'll know more later, and we may never know everything ever. In other words, information stands in the middle, and we're trying. Scientists are gaining some clarity, but it's going to take some time for scientific consensus to build, and for public understanding to catch up.

    Midinformation, in other words, is the sort of information crisis that happens when not all the facts are known. In that vacuum of knowledge, all kinds of rumors, conspiracies, misunderstandings and misconceptions can emerge, because it's comforting to have an anchor that feels true and reliable.

    **We might define midinformation as informational ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, often about emerging scientific knowledge.** And the COVID-19 pandemic is rife with it. The usual media literacy course teaches basic things: vet your sources, look for corroborating evidence, [read laterally](https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/). But the phenomenon of midinformation requires new skills, for journalists, educators and all of us.

    Here are some:

    ### __Take a breather.__

    This one's obvious, but in an attention economy, it's harder and harder to resist checking the news. Doomscrolling, as [WIRED writer Angela Watercutter](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/) has pointed out, makes us *feel* better prepared for what's going on, but it might actually be hurting us.

    > Right now, people are living at a time with no easy solutions, a moment with a lot of conflicting "facts" in a rapidly changing landscape. According to Nicole Ellison, who studies communication and social media at the University of Michigan's School of Information, that means there's a "lot of demand on cognitive processing to make sense of this. There's no overarching narrative that helps us." That, she adds, only compounds the stress and anxiety they're already feeling.

    Watercutter points out that COVID-19 isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. We have to take care of our mental health, recognize when our attention to the news might be destructive, and to remember that resolution to the pandemic will take time, at the scale of years, not months or weeks. To curb my own doomscrolling habit, I've been reading books and putting my phone away before going to bed.

    ### __We're doing science in public --- help people understand that.__

    The experience of the WHO researcher reflects a reality for every public health researcher: there's often no data, and when there is data, it's not validated or vetted, and it might even be in conflict with other studies. The scientific method demands replicability of results, but this process can take months, if not years, far slower than a typical news cycle and certainly much slower than the lightning speed of viral media. "We're six months into a pandemic," she said in her public clarification. "There's a huge amount of research that is being done, but we don't have that full picture yet."

    <p class="caption">Book Talk and Webinar: Keep Calm and Log On with author Gus Andrews</p>

    In a recent conversation I had [with author Gus Andrews](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/about-author-gillian-gus-andrews), I asked her about how we deal this. Because of significant scientific advances in the fields of physics, chemistry and astronomy, we're used to the idea of scientific consensus on key topics.

    But this is a novel coronavirus, and we're doing science in public now, she said. That means heated debates, scant data, papers that haven't been subject to peer review, and all kinds of conversations usually limited to experts but now exposed to the public by the pandemic given the enormous interest in the topic. It's vital that we help each other along in understanding what a lack of scientific consensus looks like, and [how to navigate the waters of an infodemic](https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/covid-19-infodemic/).

    And remember to focus on what we do know: stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask if you go out, etc. It's important that we not let the inevitable confusion that arises from midinformation to in turn foster information nihilism.

    ### __Bring audiences along on the journey.__

    Here's what Gus had to say: "I wonder if we can give more people the feeling that they're part of the evolving discussion by encouraging them to keep listening and educating themselves on the latest narratives. Which maybe even unfolds like a podcast or other series, where there's value and a feeling of safety in becoming part of the community that keeps engaging. We're all learning, together, and we become stronger by doing so."

    On the technical side, it's important to ensure our databases are updated regularly to ensure search results remain relevant not just by content but by time, that we have clear flags for emerging information that may change later by context or time, and that time stamps are clear and accurate. The [COVID-19 Expert Database team](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) work regularly to ensure everything is up to date, circling back on key topics as the science evolves.

    ### __Embrace ambiguity. It's what we've got.__

    Medical doctors have a lot of perspective to offer during times of ambiguous and confusing situations. Many of us have personally received word from a doctor about a health condition that our doctor is still learning about, from a broken bone to cancer. Doctors have perfected the art of expressing uncertainty in a time when people seek certainty. Most cancer diagnoses come with caveats, qualifications and "we simply don't know."

    Saying "I dont' know," as medical journalist Seema Yasmin regularly points out, is an important way for doctors to build trust. Somewhere between information nihilism and a blanket trust in unverified facts comes the harsh reality: we as a society have to accept and live with ambiguity for a significant amount of time. "We don't know yet, but check back in," is a tough pill to swallow, but it's the closest thing we have to truth right now for a lot of aspects of this disease, and it opens up audiences for an invitation to keeping checking in as we learn more.

    other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first six months
    of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately, misinformation
    about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n- Foods breastfeeding
    mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
    should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
    for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the taste
    of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
    is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
    negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
    based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed if
    she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
    moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk passes
    on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always check with
    your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in the coronavirus
    pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted in brand new types
    of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
    Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
    from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
    and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
    of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
    lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
    leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
    of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
    by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
    [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
    separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
    [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
    decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
    inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
    and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
    Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
    undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
    during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
    understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
    with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
    and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
    becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
    that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
    a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
    is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
    of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
    in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
    on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
    addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
    decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are not
    immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO advises
    that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding is recommended
    for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding with their healthcare
    providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding. 2020. ](https://waba.org.my)https://waba.org.my

  body: "In the 1300s during the Black Plague, before scientists could diagnose the
    cause of the disease (a bacterium now called Yersinia pestis), [religious cures,
    potions and bloodletting](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1540/medieval-cures-for-the-black-death/)
    filled anxiety-inducing gaps in information that contemporary medical knowledge
    could not. Generations later, during the Spanish Flu, before its true biology
    was discovered, even[ many scientists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2118275/)
    believed wrongly that the disease came from the same bacterium that caused illnesses
    like anthrax, cholera, and plague. Today, in the throes of this pandemic, we see
    similar misinformation surrounding COVID-19 treatments, cures and preventions,
    all spreading across the internet before they’ve been verified or refuted by good
    science. \n\nIn each of these cases, the need or desire to know a truth outpaces
    the discovery of that truth *(\"How much should we be testing? How did the virus
    spread? What are the symptoms? What are the cures?\")*. So people make stuff up.
    They latch onto theories, maybe because bad information and hasty news is more
    comforting than no information at all. It's a problem we might call [“midinformation,\"](https://meedan.com/blog/missing-information-not-just-misinformation-is-part-of-the-problem/),
    or informational ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, often about
    emerging scientific knowledge.\n\nThere is a growing global need for a generation
    of journalists who can help the public root through the noise of the internet
    and get to the bottom of the chaos. More than just a baseline need for journalism
    and high quality reporting (which is equally critical and proactive), the failures
    of governments, platforms and information leaders during COVID-19, coupled with
    the public's growing skepticism of science, call for more of us to be able to
    spot midinformation and misinformation, discern its different manifestations,
    debunk claims online, and spread the message. We are hoping to address these challenges
    through Check U, a new vertical at Meedan that trains university students to spot
    and verify misleading information. \n\nThis is important now more than ever. Waning
    public trust in authorities, coupled with an evolving disease in which research
    and science changes daily, is predictably sowing confusion, and opening gaps for
    bad actors to manipulate online narratives. We’re seeing this virtually everywhere.
    \n\n- In the Philippines, top leaders [spread misinformation](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-manila-vice-mayor-lacuna-demos-wrong-w)
    about how to properly wear masks in public\n\n- In India, health misinformation
    is [intertwined](https://meedan.com/reports/coronavirus-misinformation-in-india-is-not-limited-to-health-misinformation/)
    with existing divided narratives between Hindus and Muslims and people are confused
    by false information about ayurvedic “cures”\n\n- Governments around the world[
    are not communicating health information](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/covid-19-minority-languages)
    in minority languages\n\n- In Tribal regions in the United States and Canada,
    government guidelines are [widely out of touch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/09/systemic-inequities-increase-covid-19-risk-indigenous-people-canada)
    with the reality of indigenous, community-centered living\n\nThe gaps are slightly
    different in every region, but the trend is observable across language, demographics
    and other divides: people are in need of high quality health information, not
    just because of the general and obvious importance of being able to discern what’s
    true from what’s false, but because knowing things about health [leads to doing
    things about health](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730.2013.768727).
    Literally. Knowing the ground truth about vaccine safety [can lead to](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1500506X)
    getting vaccinated. Knowing the public health benefits of mask wearing [has been
    shown](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2020-economic-commentaries/ec-202020-survey-results-on-mask-wearing-behaviors-and-beliefs.aspx)
    to contribute to people wearing masks. If your information is wrong, unrealistic,
    misleading, or inaccessible because of language or literacy, then the things you’ll
    do with that information (or lack thereof it) [may be](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/health-literacy)
    incorrect and unsafe. Conspiracy theories about vaccination lead people I know
    not only to not vaccinate, but to also spread those conspiracy theories so that
    others don’t vaccinate either.\n\nThrough [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/credcatalog/),
    our joint program with Hacks/Hackers, we’re launching a Google News Initiative-supported
    series of Fall 2020 training programs in which students from Germany, Yemen, Syria,
    Cairo, the United States and other places learn critical debunking skills amid
    a century-defining pandemic. All together, we’ll be training more than 1,100 students
    from 14 universities. To this end, we’re doing the following:\n\n- Developing
    a syllabus with Syracuse University’s [Jennifer Grygiel](https://newhouse.syr.edu/faculty-staff/jennifer-grygiel)
    \n\n- Walking students through sourcing, screening, categorizing and debunking
    claims\n\n- Using [Check](https://meedan.com/check), Meedan’s online verification
    tool, as a collaborative education platform on which to train and evaluate students
    \n\nToday’s online environment exacerbates the spread of all forms of misleading
    content by amplifying false or understudied theories, leading to poor health outcomes
    worldwide. The internet's decentralization of information, and ensuing decentralization
    of information authority triggers a big chunk of the spread of what's now known
    as [misinfodemics](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/).
    It also calls for solutions that are as powerful and scaleable as the problem
    itself.\n\nThis is just the beginning of our efforts to educate professionals
    and students about responsible ways to debunk claims related to topics as critical
    as our own health and well-being. It builds off many years of Meedan experience
    in this realm, from our initial collaboration with the University of Hong Kong’s
    Cyber Verification Lab to UC Berkeley’s Human Rights Center to our ONA Challenge
    Grant project with the University of Nevada Reno’s Reynolds School of Journalism.
    These lessons have taught us that the act of fact-checking and verification is
    one of the best tools for learning about these processes, and we’re excited to
    formalize this at a new level."

  body: |-
    Early in the days of COVID-19, as it was just starting to leave the confines of East Asia, a number of people I know started calling the then-emergent pandemic a "black swan event." This is a metaphor for something very rare and difficult to predict. It would be a fitting one if COVID-19 was like the Spanish Flu---a once in a century event that wreaks havoc and then is quickly forgotten. It's become popular in finance circles thanks to the work of options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb. As summarized in Wikipedia, [Black swan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) has three key charateristics:

    1.  The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.

    2.  The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).

    3.  The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and to a rare event's massive role in historical affairs.

    A striking image --- just because we've never seen a black swan doesn't mean it doesn't exist ---, it's wholly inadequate for understanding COVID-19. [An article in Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90475793/why-the-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-gray-rhino-and-not-a-black-swan) helped me understand and dispense with that metaphor pretty quickly:

    > But true linguists say that the proper metaphor for the crisis is a "gray rhino," which refers to highly probable but neglected threats that have an enormous impact. It was coined by Michele Wucker, a policy analyst who came up with the term after the 2012 Greek financial crisis.

    Indeed, nearly two years ago,[  Atlantic writer Ed Yong pointed out that the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/)---and, as we've learned, the world---is simply not ready for a pandemic:

    > Perhaps most important, the U.S. is prone to the same forgetfulness and shortsightedness that befall all nations, rich and poor---and the myopia has worsened considerably in recent years. Public-health programs are low on money; hospitals are stretched perilously thin; crucial funding is being slashed. And while we tend to think of science when we think of pandemic response, the worse the situation, the more the defense depends on political leadership.

    > When Ebola flared in 2014, the science-minded President Barack Obama calmly and quickly took the reins. The White House is now home to a president who is neither calm nor science-minded. We should not underestimate what that may mean if risk becomes reality.

    ![This pandemic isn’t a swan—it’s a canary](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6hTpSXjNGPRuVKV4KnuGZs/08f9b2b3458c7197cff220daed69a6f6/EF3E3911-3032-4865-AC7A-D096912D60ED.JPG)
    <p class="caption">Image CC BY-NC-ND Rose Davies on Flickr</p>

    Many have seen this rhino coming. It was standing there all along. As early as 2017, [the Pentagon was aware of the risks](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/05/827692672/report-pentagon-aware-of-possible-coronavirus-threat-for-years), and the film [Contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film)), shot in 2011 and depicting a global pandemic and its effects on common people and institutions alike, feels eerily prescient but is only predictive because it's based on solid science about pandemic risk.

    But as I learn more about the pandemic and the conditions that enabled it to spread so quickly---poor public health systems, science denialism, and the steady encroachment of humans onto animal environments, among other factors---I think another metaphor is more fitting: the canary in the coal mine.

    Consider the words of health writer Sonia Shah [in a recent cover story for The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/pandemic-definition-covid/):

    > It's time for a new story, one that more accurately captures the reality of how contagions unfold and why. In this story, pandemics would be cast as both a biological reality and a social phenomenon shaped by human agency. And the coronavirus, if cast as any kind of monster at all, would be a Frankenstein's monster: a creature of our own making. We, after all, created the world in which SARS-Cov-2 evolved, one in which our industry has swallowed up so much of the planet that microbes from wild animals easily slip into livestock and humans. We created the society of overcrowded prisons and nursing homes staffed by underpaid employees who must work in multiple facilities to make ends meet; in which employers force their workers to labor on meatpacking lines even if they're sick; in which asylum seekers are crammed into detention centers; and in which people living in hard-hit cities like Detroit lack access to clean water with which to wash their hands.

    > A narrative that elevates these realities would compel us to consider a much wider range of policy responses to counter the threat of pandemics. Instead of blaming outsiders and waiting for magic bullet cures, we could work to enhance our resilience and reduce the probability of pathogens reaching us in the first place. Instead of reflexively demanding that killing chemicals be slathered across the landscape to destroy mosquitoes infected by the West Nile virus and ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria, we could restore the lost biodiversity that once prevented their spread. We could protect the forests where bats roost, so that Ebola, SARS, and other viruses stay in them and don't find their way into human populations.

    The phrase "canary in a coal mine" comes from an English-language metaphor based on the fact that canaries--which are more susceptible to methane than human beings--were brought to mines as a precaution. If the canary died, it meant methane was leaking, and that people needed to evacuate immediately. The canary was a warning that something was wrong with the mine, and that greater danger lay ahead.

    Instead of a black swan or a gray rhino, we might call COVID-19 a yellow canary event --- an event that warns of even greater dangers to come.  Like the real-world canary in the coal mine, the death of something we like is a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with the metaphorical mine we live in.

    We might consider yellow canary event as having some of the following characteristics:

    -   A signal that is itself disturbing but to an expert is doubly so because of the conditions it reveals;

    -   Hurts vulnerable populations and systems first, in a highly visible way;

    -   Exposes a structural weakness that will cause tremendous harm to everyone if allowed to continue

    This is COVID-19: it is a biological entity with sociological roots and geopolitical effects. And as it harms black, indigenous and people of color and global south communities more than others, as it strikes the elderly and the infirm and the underpaid and migrants, and as the response becomes politicized, we are reaping the consequences of many significant societal problems. It's not a coincidence that Black Lives Matter and other social movements are rising now --- the pandemic is the yellow canary for the fissures we've allowed to form in society that have generally been ignored.

    The misinfodemics around the pandemic are deeply intertwined with these challenges. [In a 2018 article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), colleague Nat Gyenes and I looked at some of the underlying conditions that have created a field of risk: search engine algorithms and social media feeds based on attention, long-running distrust in science, the complexity with which science is communicated. Much of public health, we wrote, "remains focused on providing communications guidelines and engaging in traditional broadcast-diffusion strategies, but not search-engine optimization, viral marketing campaigns, and accessing populations through social-diffusion approaches."

    COVID-19 is a yellow canary event for the kind of environmental destruction we should expect globally, the racial and global inequalities we've allowed and encouraged to fester, the information ecosystems we've funded through advertising, and a long-running denialism of both the social and biological sciences. When miners see a dead canary, they know it's time to evacuate. But in the context of a global pandemic, there's nowhere else to go. We have to face it, understand the underlying causes, and do our best to change them.

  body: "Meedan is leading this project that aims to mobilize the Latin American activist
    community around the [risks related](https://globalvoices.org/2019/05/01/envision-a-new-war-the-syrian-archive-corporate-censorship-and-the-struggle-to-preserve-public-history-online/)
    to corporate social media platforms becoming responsible for preserving the history
    and memory of activist movements, while there is still a total lack of transparency
    regarding its content moderation policies and private interests.\n\nThe objective
    of every archive should be to share the memory of movements, to create belonging
    and ties with communities and to save collective history. But, how to ensure that
    there is a story to tell and study in the future when these records are on private
    platforms? The idea here is to ensure that memories of resistance are preserved.\n\n###
    Erasing Latin American resistance history, now in the digital context\nThe history
    of Latin America is marked by the erasure of resistance. First with the genocides
    of indigenous people [that occurred](https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/nosso-mundo/brasil-e-lider-disparado-no-genocidio-de-indios-na-america-latina-24042018)
    across the continent and that decimated civilizations that tried to resist European
    invaders over the centuries and later through [military dictatorships](https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/leonardo-sakamoto/2020/07/15/militares-se-chocam-com-genocidio-apos-o-genocidio-indigena-na-ditadura.htm),
    corrupt governaments, and [racist eugenic](https://www.almapreta.com/editorias/realidade/existe-genocidio-negro-no-brasil)
    policies.\n\nThis process extends to the present day, in 2019 Latin America was
    considered the most dangerous region in the world for human rights activists,
    according to [Amnesty International](https://anistia.org.br/noticias/da-retorica-pratica-2019-foi-um-ano-marcado-por-retrocessos-para-os-direitos-humanos-brasil-mostra-relatorio/),
    with 210 people killed. This count includes LGBTQI +, women's rights and anti-corruption
    advocates. It is the region that has [killed most journalists](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055601)
    this past year, twenty-two members of the press have been murdered. 2020 marks
    a period in which the region has become the epicenter of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2020/06/24/america-latina-supera-100-mil-mortes-por-covid-19.ghtml),
    with worsening economic instability and [conservative governments](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/crise-multinivel-na-america-latina-esta-mais-complexa.shtml)
    that flirt with militarism in the region.\n\nThe pandemic caused this activism
    that took the streets with the [Feminist Spring](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-09/milhares-de-mulheres-mostram-sua-forca-nas-ruas-da-america-latina.html)
    to turn to social networks and technologies, as is the case of [indigenous leaders
    ](https://revistamarieclaire.globo.com/Mulheres-do-Mundo/noticia/2020/08/unindo-tradicao-e-tecnologia-mulheres-indigenas-lideram-enfrentamento-pandemia.html)who
    organize themselves in WhatsApp groups and use social media channels to hold events
    live from inside their homes. It is essential given this scenario to understand
    that social media platforms have a central role as disseminators of this content
    and as a digital agora. However, they are corporate companies and not elected
    governments and representative of democratic values responsible for guarding and
    ensuring that these memories and narratives are preserved and have space to be
    communicated.\n\nActivism content on social media remains at risk of exclusion,
    hacking or censorship this has happened before, when YouTube's new algorithmic
    policies, launched in 2017, led to the disappearance overnight of the documentation
    of human rights abuses in Syria . According to the 2019 report by the [EFF (Eletronic
    Frontier Foundation), \"Stuck in the network: the impact of 'extremist' speech
    regulations on human rights content\"](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content),
    in which YouTube used automatic signage with machine learning to withdraw thousands
    of Syrian YouTube channels that were publishing videos documenting human rights
    violations.\n\nThere is a constant tension between social media platforms with
    their non-transparent content moderation policies and the presence of content
    from communities considered diverse. We see content primarily related to freedom
    of expression and diversity being removed from these spaces, as identified by
    [research conducted by Salty](https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/)
    (an American newsletter) with his readers on the bias of algorithms, policing
    content by social media platforms when focused on race, queer and gender content.
    This research is one example that shows how marginalized communities are disproportionately
    affected by I[nstagram's content policies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive).\n\nThis
    project is being initiated based on the absence of data for research regarding
    the content of Latin American activists being removed from social media platforms.
    There are initiatives by institutions and civil organizations in the region that
    are [articulating conversations and recommendations](https://tiinside.com.br/04/08/2020/organizacoes-brasileiras-e-latino-americanas-lancam-documento-sobre-regulacao-de-grandes-plataformas-online/)
    on the lack of transparency regarding the applied policies and the use of content
    moderation algorithms.\n\n### Collaborating and dialoguing with the community\nWe
    had the opportunity to discuss this issue and project with the Internet [Freedom
    Festival Glitter Meetup community](https://www.internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/July_16_2020_GM),
    and at the international human rights event [RightsCon 2020 - Recordkeepers of
    the Resistance](https://rightscon.course.tc/2020/events/recordkeepers-of-the-resistance-do-you-trust-the-dark-force-to-save-your-activist-history-8bqf3iLHDWWpwxSnGzxBRB/).\n\n###
    The project phases\n\n#### 1. Validation of the hypothesis\nResearch with activist
    communities through a questionnaire and data collection to validate the hypothesis:
    \"Activists are having their content removed from social networking platforms
    in Latin America\".\n\n#### 2. Network working group\nCreate a working group with
    representatives of civil human rights organizations to analyze the data and organize
    the information;\n  \n#### 3. Content creation activities with and for the activist
    community\nCreate a listening process with the communities, map the needs and
    gather case studies, collaborate in contextualized toolkits and workshops for
    the preservation of activist digital content;\n\n#### 4. Consortium and code of
    ethics\nCreate a code of ethics for archiving social media content and mediation
    with social media platforms.\n\n__Want to collaborate with us?__\nRespond and
    share this [survey](https://forms.gle/mr4uGQU59ATuq9fAA) with Latin American activists\n\n[<LINK
    TO SURVEY IN ESPANISH AND PORTUGUESE>](https://forms.gle/mr4uGQU59ATuq9fAA \"Link
    to the survey \")\n\n#### Objective of this study\nThe purpose of this study is
    to collect and analyze information about activists who use social networks in
    Latin America to carry out their activism and preserve their history and memory.
    The survey will take approximately 8 minutes to complete. The results of this
    study will improve our understanding of activists and their practices to preserve
    the memory of their resistance movements in Latin America and how they are affected
    by content moderation policies on social media platforms.\n\n#### Study Methodology
    and Survey\nYou will receive a series of 15 questions and complete an anonymous
    online survey. The questions are about your experiences using social media and
    how they affected your activism and / or the organization of memory in your community,
    your movement and activism practice. Answer the questions in the best possible
    way and feel free to ignore all the questions that you are not comfortable answering.\n\n####
    Questions about gender identity, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity\nIt is
    necessary to understand whether the policies implemented by the platforms affect
    differently the people who express their identity and resistance practices in
    these channels. All answers are optional, but it is necessary to emphasize the
    importance of these markers in the analysis.\n\n#### Privacy and Trust\nWe understand
    that the information you will share might be of a sensitive and private nature,
    that is why this is an anonymous survey, all data is anonymous and will be analysed
    as such. If you have security concerns when filling out this survey we encorage
    you to open the survey link in an anonymous tab on your browser as well as the
    use of a VPN service.\n\n#### Risks / Benefits\nPlease, ignore any questions you
    want or end the survey at any time. It's possible that through contributing to
    this research you may have the opportunity to reflect on your experiences with
    using social media in recent months and the need for independent content preservation
    practices. \n\n#### Community\nThe materials and reports created from this survey
    will be shared with the community. If you know an organization that is doing similar
    work, share it and let's connect!\n"

    Meedan lidera este proyecto que tiene como objetivo movilizar a la comunidad activista latinoamericana en torno a [los riesgos relacionados](https://globalvoices.org/2019/05/01/envision-a-new-war-the-syrian-archive-corporate-censorship-and-the-struggle-to-preserve-public-history-online/ "Una nueva guerra el archivo sirio y la censura corporativa una lucha por preservar la historia publica online") con que las plataformas de redes sociales corporativas se hagan responsables de preservar la historia y la memoria de los movimientos activistas, mientras aún existe una falta total de transparencia respecto sus políticas de moderación de contenidos e intereses privados.

    El objetivo de todo archivo debe ser compartir la memoria de los movimientos, crear pertenencia y vínculos con las comunidades y salvar la historia colectiva. Pero, ¿cómo asegurarse de que haya una historia que contar y estudiar en el futuro cuando estos registros estén en plataformas privadas? La idea aquí es garantizar que se conserven los recuerdos de resistencia.

    ### Borrando la resistencia latinoamericana ahora en el contexto digital
    La historia de América Latina está marcada por el borrado de la resistencia. Primero con los genocidios de [pueblos indígenas](https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/nosso-mundo/brasil-e-lider-disparado-no-genocidio-de-indios-na-america-latina-24042018) ocurridos en todo el continente y que diezmaron a lo largo de los siglos las civilizaciones que intentaron resistir a los invasores europeos y luego a través de [dictaduras militares](https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/leonardo-sakamoto/2020/07/15/militares-se-chocam-com-genocidio-apos-o-genocidio-indigena-na-ditadura.htm), gobiernos corruptos y políticas [eugenésicas racistas](https://www.almapreta.com/editorias/realidade/existe-genocidio-negro-no-brasil).

    Este proceso se extiende hasta la actualidad, en 2019 América Latina fue considerada la región más peligrosa del mundo para los activistas de derechos humanos, según[ Amnistía Internacional](https://anistia.org.br/noticias/da-retorica-pratica-2019-foi-um-ano-marcado-por-retrocessos-para-os-direitos-humanos-brasil-mostra-relatorio/), con 210 personas asesinadas. Este recuento incluye LGBTQI +, defensores de los derechos de las mujeres y anticorrupción. Es la región que más [periodistas ha asesinado](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055601) el año pasado, veintidós miembros de la prensa han sido asesinados. 2020 marca un período en el que la región se ha convertido en el epicentro de la [pandemia COVID-19](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2020/06/24/america-latina-supera-100-mil-mortes-por-covid-19.ghtml), con un empeoramiento de la inestabilidad económica y [gobiernos conservadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/crise-multinivel-na-america-latina-esta-mais-complexa.shtml) que coquetean con el militarismo en la región.

    La pandemia provocó que este activismo que tomó las calles con la [Primavera Feminista](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-09/milhares-de-mulheres-mostram-sua-forca-nas-ruas-da-america-latina.html) se volviera hacia las redes sociales y las tecnologías, como es el caso de [líderes indígenas](https://revistamarieclaire.globo.com/Mulheres-do-Mundo/noticia/2020/08/unindo-tradicao-e-tecnologia-mulheres-indigenas-lideram-enfrentamento-pandemia.html) que se organizan en grupos de WhatsApp y utilizan los canales de las redes sociales para realizar eventos viven desde el interior de sus casas. Ante este escenario es fundamental entender que las plataformas de redes sociales tienen un papel central como difusores de este contenido y como ágora digital. Sin embargo, son empresas corporativas y no gobiernos electos y representantes de los valores democráticos responsables de velar y asegurar que
    estos recuerdos y narrativas se conservan y tienen espacio para comunicarse.

    El contenido de activismo en las redes sociales sigue en riesgo de exclusión, piratería o censura, esto ha sucedido antes, cuando las nuevas políticas algorítmicas de YouTube, lanzadas en 2017, llevaron a la desaparición de la noche a la mañana de la documentación de abusos de derechos humanos en Siria. . Según el informe de 2019 de la [EFF (Eletronic Frontier Foundation), "Atrapado en la red: el impacto de las regulaciones del discurso 'extremista' en el contenido de derechos humanos"](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content), en el que YouTube utilizó la señalización automática con aprendizaje automático para retirar miles de canales de YouTube sirios que publicaban videos que documentaban violaciones de derechos humanos.

    Existe una tensión constante entre las plataformas de redes sociales con sus políticas de moderación de contenido no transparentes y la presencia de contenido de comunidades consideradas diversas. Vemos contenido principalmente relacionado con la libertad de expresión y la diversidad que se elimina de estos espacios, según lo identificado por una [investigación realizada por Salty ](https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/)(un boletín de noticias estadounidense) con sus lectores sobre el sesgo de los algoritmos, controlando el contenido de las plataformas de redes sociales cuando se enfoca en la raza, contenido queer y de género. Esta investigación es un ejemplo que muestra cómo las comunidades marginadas se ven afectadas de manera desproporcionada por las[ políticas de contenido de Instagram](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive).

    Este proyecto se inicia en base a la ausencia de datos para la investigación sobre el contenido de los activistas latinoamericanos que se retiran de las plataformas de redes sociales. Existen iniciativas de instituciones y organizaciones civiles de la región que están [articulando conversaciones y recomendaciones](https://tiinside.com.br/04/08/2020/organizacoes-brasileiras-e-latino-americanas-lancam-documento-sobre-regulacao-de-grandes-plataformas-online/) sobre la falta de transparencia en cuanto a las políticas aplicadas y el uso de algoritmos de moderación de contenidos.

    ### Colaborar y dialogar con la comunidad
    Tuvimos la oportunidad de discutir este tema y proyecto con la comunidad de [ Glitter Meetup del Festival de la Libertad de Internet (Internet Freedom Festival)](https://www.internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/July_16_2020_GM), y en el evento internacional de derechos humanos [RighstCon 2020 - Recordkeepers of the Resistance](https://rightscon.course.tc/2020/events/recordkeepers-of-the-resistance-do-you-trust-the-dark-force-to-save-your-activist-history-8bqf3iLHDWWpwxSnGzxBRB/).

    ### Las fases del proyecto

    #### 1 - Validación de la hipótesis
    Investigación con comunidades de activistas a través de un cuestionario y recopilación de datos para validar la hipótesis: "Los activistas están eliminando su contenido de las plataformas s de las redes sociales en América Latina ".
    #### 2 - Grupo de trabajo en red
    Crear un grupo de trabajo con representantes de organizaciones civiles de derechos humanos para analizar los datos y organizar la información;

    #### 3 - Actividades de creación de contenido con y para la comunidad activista
    Crear un proceso de escucha con las comunidades, mapear las necesidades y recopilar casos de estudio, colaborar en kits de herramientas contextualizados y talleres para la preservación del contenido digital activista;

    #### 4 - Consorcio y código ético
    Cree un código de ética para archivar contenido de redes sociales y mediación con plataformas de redes sociales.

    #### Objetivo de este estudio
    El propósito de este estudio es recolectar y analizar información sobre activistas que utilizan las redes sociales en América Latina para llevar a cabo su activismo y comprender mejor sus prácticas de preservación de su historia y memoria. La encuesta tardará aproximadamente 8 minutos en completarse. Los resultados de este estudio mejorarán nuestra comprensión de los activistas y sus prácticas para preservar la memoria de sus movimientos de resistencia en América Latina y cómo se ven afectados por las políticas de moderación de contenido en las plataformas de redes sociales.

    #### Metodología de estudio y encuesta
    Recibirá una serie de 15 preguntas y completará una encuesta anónima en línea.

    \"O arquivo sírio e a censura corporativa uma luta para preservar a história pública
    online\") às plataformas corporativas de mídia social se tornarem responsáveis
    por preservar a história e memória dos movimentos ativistas, enquanto ainda existe
    uma total falta de transparência em relação a suas políticas de moderação de conteúdo
    e interesses privados.\n\nO objetivo de todo arquivo deve ser compartilhar a memória
    de movimentos, criar pertencimento e laços com as comunidades e de salvar a história
    coletiva. Mas, como garantir que haja uma história para contar e estudar no futuro
    quando estes registros estão em plataformas privadas? A idéia aqui é garantir
    que as memórias da resistência sejam preservadas.\n\n### Apagamento das resistências
    latino-americanas agora no contexto digital\nA história da América Latina é marcada
    por apagamentos de resistências. Primeiro com os genocídios de indígenas [que
    ocorreram](https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/nosso-mundo/brasil-e-lider-disparado-no-genocidio-de-indios-na-america-latina-24042018)
    por todo o continente e que dizimaram ao longo dos séculos as civilizações que
    tentaram resistir aos invasores europeus e posteriormente através de [ditaduras
    militares](https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/leonardo-sakamoto/2020/07/15/militares-se-chocam-com-genocidio-apos-o-genocidio-indigena-na-ditadura.htm),
    governos corruptos e políticas [eugênicas racistas](https://www.almapreta.com/editorias/realidade/existe-genocidio-negro-no-brasil).
    \n\nEste processo se estende aos dias atuais,  em 2019 a América Latina foi considerada
    a região mais perigosa do mundo para ativistas de direitos humanos, de acordo
    com a [Anistia Internacional](https://anistia.org.br/noticias/da-retorica-pratica-2019-foi-um-ano-marcado-por-retrocessos-para-os-direitos-humanos-brasil-mostra-relatorio/),
    com 210 pessoas mortas. Essa contagem inclui defensores LGBTQI +, dos direitos
    das mulheres e anticorrupção. É a região que mais [matou jornalistas ](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055601)neste
    último ano, vinte e dois membros da imprensa foram assassinados. O ano de 2020
    marca um período em que a região se tornou o epicentro da [pandemia do COVID-19](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2020/06/24/america-latina-supera-100-mil-mortes-por-covid-19.ghtml),
    com agravamento da instabilidade econômica e de [governos conservadores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/crise-multinivel-na-america-latina-esta-mais-complexa.shtml)
    que flertam com o militarismo na região. \n\nA pandemia fez com que esse ativismo
    que tomou as ruas com a [Primavera Feminista](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-09/milhares-de-mulheres-mostram-sua-forca-nas-ruas-da-america-latina.html)
    se voltasse para as redes sociais e as tecnologias, como é o caso das [lideranças
    indígenas ](https://revistamarieclaire.globo.com/Mulheres-do-Mundo/noticia/2020/08/unindo-tradicao-e-tecnologia-mulheres-indigenas-lideram-enfrentamento-pandemia.html)que
    se organizam em grupos de WhatsApp e se utilizam dos canais de mídias sociais
    para fazerem eventos ao vivo de dentro de suas casas. Se faz essencial dado esse
    cenário compreender que as plataformas de mídias sociais passam a ter um papel
    central de disseminadores desse conteúdo e como uma ágora digital. Entretanto,
    são empresas corporativas e não governos eleitos e representativos de valores
    democráticos responsáveis por guardar e garantir que \nessas memórias e narrativas
    sejam preservadas e tenham espaço para serem comunicadas. \n\nO conteúdo de ativismo
    em redes sociais permanece sob risco de exclusão, hackeamento ou censura isso
    já aconteceu antes, quando as novas políticas algorítmicas do YouTube, lançadas
    em 2017, levaram ao desaparecimento da noite para o dia da documentação de abusos
    de direitos humanos na Síria. De acordo com o relatório de 2019 da [EFF (Eletronic
    Frontier Foundation),\"Preso na rede: o impacto das regulamentações 'extremistas'
    de discurso sobre o conteúdo dos direitos humanos\"](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content),
    em que o YouTube usou a sinalização automática com aprendizado de máquina para
    retirar milhares de canais sírios do YouTube que estavam publicando vídeos documentando
    violações dos direitos humanos.\n\nExiste uma constante tensão entre as plataformas
    de mídia social com suas políticas nada transparentes de moderação de conteúdo
    e a presença de conteúdo de comunidades consideradas diversas. Vemos conteúdo
    principalmente relacionado à liberdade de expressão e diversidade sendo retirado
    desses espaços, como foi identificado pela [pesquisa conduzida por Salty](https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/)
    (um newsletter americano) com seus leitores sobre o viés de algoritmos o policiamento
    de conteúdo por plataformas de mídia social quando focado em raça, conteúdo queer
    e de gênero. Essa pesquisa é um dos exemplos que mostra como comunidades marginalizadas
    são desproporcionalmente afetadas pelas [políticas de conteúdo do Instagram.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive)
    \n\nEste projeto está sendo iniciado baseado na ausência de dados para pesquisa
    em relação ao conteúdo de ativistas da América Latina que está sendo retirado
    das plataformas de redes sociais. Existem iniciativas de instituições e organizações
    civis na região que estão [articulando conversas e recomendações](https://tiinside.com.br/04/08/2020/organizacoes-brasileiras-e-latino-americanas-lancam-documento-sobre-regulacao-de-grandes-plataformas-online/)
    sobre a falta de transparência quanto às políticas aplicadas e o uso de algoritmos
    de moderação de conteúdo. \n\n### Colaborando e dialogando com a comunidade\nTivemos
    a oportunidade de dialogar sobre este assunto e projeto com a comunidade do [Internet
    Freedom Festival Glitter Meetup](https://www.internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/July_16_2020_GM),
    e no evento internacional de direitos humanos[ RighstCon 2020 - Recordkeepers
    of the Resistance](https://rightscon.course.tc/2020/events/recordkeepers-of-the-resistance-do-you-trust-the-dark-force-to-save-your-activist-history-8bqf3iLHDWWpwxSnGzxBRB/).\n\n###
    As fases do projeto\n\n#### 1 - Validação da hipótese\nPesquisa com comunidades
    ativistas através de questionário e coleta de dados para validação da hipótese:
    \"Ativistas estão tendo seu conteúdo retirado das plataformas de redes socias
    na América Latina\".\n\n#### 2 - Grupo de trabalho em rede\nCriar um grupo de
    trabalho com representantes de organizações civis de direitos humanos para analisar
    os dados e organizar as informações;\n#### 3 - Atividades de criação de conteúdo
    com e para a comunidade de ativistas\nCriar um processo de escuta com as comunidades,
    mapear as necessidades e reunir caso de estudos, colaborar em toolkits e workshops
    contextualizados para a preservação de conteúdo digital ativista;\n\n#### 4 -
    Consortium e código de ética\nCriar um código de ética para arquivamento de conteúdo
    ativista em redes sociais e mediação com as plataformas de mídias sociais. \n\n__Quer

    com ativistas da América Latina \n\n#### Objetivo deste estudo\nO objetivo deste
    estudo é coletar e analisar informações sobre ativistas que utilizam as redes
    sociais na América Latina para realizar seu ativismo e compreender melhor suas
    práticas de preservação de sua história e memória. A pesquisa levará aproximadamente
    8 minutos para ser concluída. Os resultados deste estudo irão melhorar nossa compreensão
    sobre ativistas e suas práticas para preservar a memória de seus movimentos de
    resistência na América Latina e como eles são afetados pelas políticas de moderação
    de conteúdo nas plataformas de mídia social.\n\n#### Metodologia de estudo e pesquisa\nVocê
    receberá uma série de 15 perguntas e preencherá uma pesquisa online anônima. As
    perguntas são sobre suas experiências usando as mídias sociais e como elas afetaram
    seu ativismo e / ou a organização da memória em sua comunidade, seu movimento
    e prática ativista. Responda às perguntas da melhor maneira possível e fique à
    vontade para ignorar todas as perguntas para as quais não se sinta confortável
    em responder.\n\n#### Perguntas sobre identidade de gênero, orientação sexual,
    raça e etnia\nÉ necessário entender se as políticas implementadas pelas plataformas
    afetam de forma diferenciada as pessoas que expressam sua identidade e as práticas
    de resistência nesses canais. Todas as respostas são opcionais, mas é necessário
    enfatizar a importância desses marcadores na análise.\n\n#### Privacidade e confiança\nEntendemos
    que as informações que você vai compartilhar podem ser de natureza sensível e
    privada, por isso esta é uma pesquisa anônima, todos os dados são anônimos e serão
    analisados como tal. Se você tiver preocupações com a segurança ao preencher esta

  body: "__The fields of public health and human rights are inextricably linked.__
    Increasingly, access to information is a mediator of access to health. The important
    role that digital rights plays in protecting and promoting the right to health
    was particularly pertinent this year, with panels addressing health data privacy,
    access to medicines, mental health and digital first responders, and gendered
    misinformation online. It is important to critically examine the pathways through
    which any individual or community is able to encounter health information digitally,
    and the barriers, limitations and challenges brought about by limited localization,
    zero-rated mobile data plans, inconsistent or obtrusive content removals and moderation
    decisions, especially through COVID-19, which has limited the ability of seeking
    health care in-person.\n\n— Nat Gyenes, Program Director, Digital Health Lab\n\n__We
    need to keep data about Latin America's activist memory safe.__ During this pandemic-infused
    reality I focused my attention on panels that were contextualized for Latin America
    on the subjects of censorship, content moderation and trust. I intended to create
    a mental landscape of shared concerns in the region, such as COVID-19 data colonialism
    practices and the importance of initiatives that take into account the country's
    data governance and independence during these times instead of readily sharing
    models that take national data into international service providers such as Amazon.
    \n\nFrom the learnings and context from the community came the [Recordkepers of
    the Resistance project](https://meedan.com/blog/preserving-latin-american-activist-history-on-social-media/),
    which aims to initially map activist content in Latin America related to feminist
    agendas, gender representation, race, sexual diversity and freedom of expression
    that were removed from the main corporate social media platforms. Collecting these
    data as a form of hypothesis testing is the first step. The future objective is
    to publicize this issue with materials aimed at activists in Spanish and Portuguese,
    uniting these issues in a coalition of organizations, sharing safe archiving and
    memory conservation practices and creating a Code of Ethics for archival activism
    in social networks. \n\n— Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America\n\n\n__Tech
    solutionism is still with us.__ The temptation to answer problems with software
    is often well-meaning, but the people who will be most affected are not always
    part of the design process. There was a discussion about health passports during
    pandemics. Reducing harm to vulnerable groups means any implementation would have
    to be so narrow in scope and so well-regulated that skepticism is warranted. I
    was encouraged by the sessions that were led by mental health researchers, because
    while they were talking about apps to address social issues, they started with
    recommending existing non–tech standards of care and the need to fill gaps in
    our understanding of mental health. A panel on gender-based violence, and a panel
    on trauma mitigation both addressed myths surrounding memory and resilience after
    experiencing horrible things. Mental health experts should be a core part of software
    design for human rights work.\n\n— Karen Reilly, Manager, Technology Partnerships\t\n\n__COVID-19
    isn’t a black swan—it’s a canary in the coal mine for human rights abuses.__ There
    was a distinct sense from the sessions about the stakes of this moment — at least
    year’s RightsCon, we were very keen to bring health to the conversation around
    rights, and the new context of this pandemic has made it absolutely a top priority.
    It was encouraging to see how people recognized that COVID-19 intersected with
    key human rights issues, such as content moderation and free expression, platform
    governance and responsibility, and the ongoing repression of activists and journalists.
    It made it really clear to me that the global trauma of [COVID-19 isn’t a black
    swan but rather a canary in a coal mine](https://meedan.com/blog/this-pandemic-isnt-a-swan-its-a-canary/),
    revealing the inherent weaknesses, fissures and dangers of our global digital
    society.\n\n— An Xiao Mina, Operations\n"

  body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health Organization
    described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable health guidance
    in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa we came across
    new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked allegations
    about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well, health misinformation
    is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern Nigeria about polio
    vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent allegations that Zika
    and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history of health misinformation
    - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We all carry a myth passed down
    to us by a friend or family member in the name of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis
    year at Global Fact, we (Olivia Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health
    Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck, and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought
    our reviews of academic evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view
    to expand upon best practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took
    main lessons from psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the
    insights of over 30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The
    goal was simple: develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7
    brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
    the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
    a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from getting
    traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have found that
    repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in times of crisis
    in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we come across.\n\n__But
    don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise have remained unknown.__
    Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts rated as false from traveling
    further on social media. But think about whether every claim intercepted this
    way is worth publicising further. Publicising every fact check on claims doubting
    the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can unintentionally give those claims
    much more exposure than if they had just been rated as false on social media.
    This exposure matters, because seeing something in the public domain can lead
    audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine is doubted by a lot more people
    than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells us that what we think is happening
    in society is a better predictor of our behaviors than what is actually happening.
    Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated more on our perceptions of
    what dominant social norms are rather than what they actually are. \n\n__Talk
    with public health experts__ where possible to determine whether it is necessary
    to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from getting traction through
    repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And remember that public health
    experts are also a source of trust. In times of uncertainty when rumours abound,
    including trusted public health experts in the content and dissemination of a
    fact check, can help good information stand out from the noise. \n\n__Publish
    the sources of your information, and the last time they were updated, to account
    for rapidly changing information.__ As global health scientist and vaccine uptake
    specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science is the truth of today”. This is an
    especially important concept in constantly changing health emergencies where treatments
    and public health guidelines shift based on the latest evidence. As much as you
    can communicate the fact that if something changes in a health context, it is
    actually a good thing, because it means that the public health community has stronger
    evidence to point towards a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase
    your headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
    headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
    as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of the
    debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied to fact-checking
    more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence of a fact-check
    might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n### Content\n\n__Don’t
    stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right and why. The need
    to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control in our environment
    is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations in science, religion,
    or in personal experience - but there is always a why. Simply telling the public
    that something they know is wrong, without updating their model of events, can
    make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill that gap. Clearly state what
    is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right and why. For health misinformation,
    finding resources that can assist with contextualizing the topic that you might
    be fact-checking within the larger body of health research can make this process
    easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance of building strong
    collaborations and projects directly with reliable health researchers for this
    to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary details to a minimum.__
    No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex information is particularly
    difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely to be experiencing stress.
    Make sure that the context and imagery you include in your fact checks are necessary
    to your debunk. Remember that moving images (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts)
    are particularly distracting. If your fact check includes those details, ask yourself
    what they add to the public’s understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t
    use graphic imagery that may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A
    study which looked at vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people
    who experience this attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and
    blood. We haven’t come across research that looks specifically at how graphic
    imagery shapes the interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems
    wise to not make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear
    of it.\n\n### Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__
    Research reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact
    can lead to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
    effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
    of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3 million
    lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop side effects.\n\n__Don’t
    ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals seeking health information
    or wanting to ask questions about health myths or beliefs. It is essential for
    audiences to feel comfortable seeking information that might correct long-standing
    beliefs related to their health or that of family members - a deeply personal
    and important issue for us all. It’s essential that, as a community of health
    information responders, we don’t use words like “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe
    the myths that we correct. We need to reduce the stigma of health information-seeking.
    \ Further, even a completely inaccurate health claim might have been shared with
    good intentions. It may have profound cultural or religious implications. And
    most importantly, we don’t have any evidence that humour is a more effective way
    of countering health misinformation than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor

    en-US: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

  body: "It has taken us some time to get this post written and published. First,
    because like most of our Lebanese friends, family members and colleagues based
    in Beirut and in the diaspora, we needed time to process [what has actually happened
    on August 4, 2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beirut-explosion-kills-at-least-100-injures-thousands-11596620481),
    and allow ourselves the space to get past anger, frustration, pain and anxiety,
    and write something that makes sense. Second, and probably more importantly, it
    is because we have been talking with our partners in Beirut about the best things
    to do, and the best ways to support independent media workers based on the ground
    in the aftermath of the explosion.\n\nBeirut is our home town. It is also the
    main regional base for all our Check Global programs and activities. It is where
    we organised our [first CheckCon conference ](https://nawamedia.org/blog/2017/02/02/checkcon-2017-beirut/)in
    2017, which brought together digital rights experts, journalists, and grassroots
    activists from across the region and the world. It is also where we launched our
    Check newsroom with [12 amazing journalism students from the Lebanese University](https://nawamedia.org/newsroom/teams/lebanese-newsroom/).
    Our newsroom has today [expanded](https://nawamedia.org/blog/2019/12/18/expanding-to-a-nawa-newsroom/)
    to include students from Egypt, Yemen and Syria; almost 30 journalism students
    in the region are today trained on digital media literacy skills, open-source
    investigations and fact-checking.\n\nLebanon has gone through a difficult 12 months.
    Lebanese people, fed up with a consociational sectarian and clientelist political
    system, revolted in [October 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/lebanon-brought-to-a-standstill-by-protests-over-economic-crisis)
    as the country went through total economic collapse, further aggravated by the
    spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The local currency lost [more than 60% of its
    value](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-crisis-pound-idUSKBN23H1BS),
    pushing more than half of the population below the poverty line. Independent media
    workers and organizations, which covered the protests, also bore the brunt of
    this economic crisis.\n\nSo when the Beirut port explosion rocked the city last
    month, it hit very close to home for the entire Meedan team, in nine countries
    and eight timezones -- not just because our students, team members and and many
    of our partners were directly affected, but also because we owe Beirut credit
    for many of the great things we have been able to achieve with the Check Global
    project to date. The explosion further endangered Beirutis' work, as many lost
    their homes, offices, equipment, and livelihoods.\n\nSo after consultation with
    our Beirut-based partners and our funders at Sida, we have re-allocated our travel
    budget for 2020 (one silver lining of the global pandemic? Maybe!) to set up the
    Check Global Beirut Response Fund, a $26,000 fund to support independent media
    organizations and workers on the ground. \n\nThrough the Check Global Beirut Response
    Fund, we allocated $16,000 in unrestricted funds to three vetted independent media
    organizations, which we can't name for security reasons, to support and sustain
    their investigative journalistic work. The remaining $10,000 have gone toward
    the Samir Kassir Foundation's [Media Recovery Fund](https://www.skeyesmedia.org/en/Media-Recovery-Fund)
    to cater to independent media workers' tech and equipment needs. As a [state of
    emergency was declared--and extended](https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2020/Aug-17/510442-state-of-emergency-extended-by-a-month.ashx)--in
    Beirut, effectively giving all powers to the army, the fund provided in-kind support
    in the form of a digital security training led by circumvention and privacy expert
    [Sarah Aoun](https://twitter.com/sa0un) with 25 independent journalists to provide
    protection from surveillance and censorship.\n\nBut we want to do more, and better.
    We are currently trying to leverage our existing partnerships with [HURIDOCS](https://www.huridocs.org/),
    [Syrian](https://www.syrianarchive.org/) and [Yemeni](https://yemeniarchive.org/)
    Archives, [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) and others to support archiving,
    verification and preservation of crowdsourced footage that documents the [ongoing
    protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c8qy8zrj69et/lebanon-protests), and
    the Lebanese government's [violent repression of the political movement](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-08-08/show-of-solidarity-after-blast-as-lebanon-braces-for-protest).\n\nLebanon's
    independent journalists will be forced to adapt to an increasingly precarious
    situation, as [electricity cuts intensify](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lebanons-rising-power-cuts-add-to-gloom-of-economic-crisis/2020/07/07/95498db4-c05f-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html),
    affecting internet usage -- especially indispensable during a pandemic. As far
    as Meedan goes, we are mobilizing and calling on our partners, donors, and friends
    to support Lebanon's independent media workers in these difficult times. Please
    do get in touch with us if you would like to know more about our efforts in Beirut,
    if you think you can help, or if you have any ideas about how we can do all of
    this better. You can reach the Check Global team at <a href=\"mailto:checkgrants@meedan.com\">checkgrants@meedan.com</a>."

  body: "In the last one year, Meedan has entered into new and exciting partnerships
    with fact-checking groups, newsrooms and networks focusing on human rights in
    the Asia Pacific region. With new partnerships and existing programs, we have
    a team working closely with partners and supporting their work. As part of this
    team, we're excited to welcome Sneha Alexander to Meedan. Sneha has joined us
    as the Program Associate for the Asia Pacific region. Her background in journalism
    and fact-checking will contribute to Meedan's work on these areas. \n\nCatch Sneha
    in this short Q&A here where she talks about her background, interests and fun
    facts that we're thrilled to learn about! \n\n### 1. What has been your experience
    before you joined Meedan? \n\nI came to Mumbai to pursue a Masters in Public Policy.
    During this time, I worked part-time with a travel company where I drafted itineraries
    and helped organize study tours and adventure programmes for schools and college
    students. Later I worked in the Indian news industry for 4 years. First, as a
    policy analyst cum fact-checker with BOOM, one of India’s premier fact-checking
    organizations. Later, I worked as a data journalist for the Plain Facts column
    of Mint, one of India’s leading financial dailies.  \n\n### 2. Tell us about a
    story/ assignment that you worked on that was exciting and insightful.\n\nThe
    assignments that I enjoyed the most involved fact-checking claims of top officials
    / leaders of the country, speaking to subject experts and had a direct impact
    on people’s lives.\nAn example is a story in which my co-author and I questioned
    the veracity of the government claim that Indian villages have become open defecation
    free. We pointed to the contradiction in data provided by two wings of the government
    - administrative data of Clean India Mission from the concerned ministry and [the
    household survey data of the National Statistical Organizatio](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-toilet-stats-raise-a-stink-11576658602838.html)n.
    Other than pointing to the discrepancy in data, we also reached out to subject
    experts to put in perspective the government’s claim that beneficiaries may have
    under-reported sanitation coverage. This article also attracted criticism from
    the government [in a public information bureau release](https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1596964).
    \n\n### 3. What is the Indian media and fact-checking ecosystem like? What are
    the strengths and what gaps do you see?\n\nThe Indian media and fact-checking
    ecosystem is an extremely competitive space, where organizations have the drive
    to be first to report stories and flag misinformation. Thanks to the huge country
    India is and thriving social media platforms, there is no dearth of content or
    audience. Since there is space for everyone and great scope for adoption of technology
    driven reporting, the focus should be on producing credible, non-partisan and
    fact-driven content. There also needs to be greater coverage of rural and local
    issues. \n\n### 4. What brought you to Meedan?\n\nHaving worked as a fact-checker
    and a journalist, I felt it would be great to facilitate credible journalism.
    Moreover, I was very excited by the prospect of working with the global fact-check
    community and team members from across the world in making the web a more inclusive
    and better place. \n\n### 5. What's a project you're excited about right now?\n\nI
    am excited about [Meedan’s End-to-End Fact-Checking project](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)
    involving different Indian fact-check organizations using WhatsApp tiplines and
    Check for fact-checking. Earlier, I was at the other end, a user of fact-check
    technology. Switching to the role of facilitator will provide great insights in
    understanding the intersection of technology and media. I am also very keen to
    be part of projects like the COVID-19 microgrants which support the good work
    of individuals and grassroot level media organizations that keep local issues
    in perspective and integrate communities to the larger online community. \n\nIn
    the long run, I also look forward to seeing a greater focus on data based fact-checks
    in the global fact-check space. Many times, the claims of political leaders and
    top officials are not backed by data and include misrepresentation of facts. This
    later turns out to be the ‘truth’ on social media platforms and at dinner table
    conversations giving way to hatred and other dangers. To tackle this, there needs
    to be more conversation and greater use of credible data in fact-checking.  \n\n###
    6. Tell us some fun facts about Sneha.\n\n- I enjoy following Indian politics
    and would love to be part of election and political strategizing some time in
    future\n- Acting in a film is on my bucket list. \n- A plate of chicken biriyani
    can lift my mood. \n- I love spicy food and can nibble on green chilli with almost
    anything!!\n"

    en-US: 'A collaboration on Check between The Bureau of Investigative Journalism
      and Bellingcat''s open-source intelligence community leads to extensive public
      interest reporting on the air war in Afghanistan. '
  body: "In 2019, a reporter from The [Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/)
    in London reached out to Meedan. She needed help with an investigation into airstrikes
    in Afghanistan, specifically, to document evidence of civilian harm from 21 alleged
    airstrikes that in recent years had reportedly hit civilian homes and killed family
    members.\n\n[Jess Purkiss](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/profile/jessicapurkiss)
    and her team knew that using official information from U.S. and Afghan forces
    would prove near impossible; the Bureau has been tracking strikes in Afghanistan
    for more than five years and often, both sides of the conflict deny accountability
    for harm inflicted on innocent citizens. \n\nTurning to the open web, the Bureau
    first connected with Meedan partner [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/),
    an open source investigation community well known for its investigations that
    [Meedan supports](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/articles/2014/08/06/investigating-the-mh17-crash-site-with-meedans-checkdesk/)
    through our open source verification software, Check. \n\nPurkiss set out to crowdsource
    information about her list of suspected airstrikes. Were they indeed airstrikes?
    Who was harmed by them? Where, specifically, did they happen? Whose homes were
    destroyed? Who survived? Bellingcat’s community of internet sleuths searched the
    expanses of Twitter, Facebook and other platforms for any evidence that might
    answer those questions. They logged their findings and built large bodies of evidence
    for each reported airstrike in Check, where the Bureau could review and verify
    open source submissions, ask questions and prompt answers. \n\n![edit&ltmpl=docs](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6XZGBYzHQV9OKH9zCqkFZO/f0830d02a89f8d51658197e89a7ddb14/Check-Example__1_.jpg)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">An image of the investigative workspace in Check</p>\n\nWorking
    together, the team was able to piece together some definitive narratives behind
    what happened, and to whom, as a result of these airstrikes. In a [brief of one
    incident](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2020-06-03/finding-the-faces-of-afghanistans-slaughtered-civilians)
    on the Bureau’s site, the team writes: \n\n> \"One of the strikes on the Bureau’s
    list had hit a building – a home – in  Baghlan province, north of Kabul, on July
    9, 2019. Early narratives around  this incident were conflicting. A few brief
    lines in news reports at the   time said that the Afghan Ministry of Defence had
    admitted civilians had died in a strike, but stopped short of taking responsibility.
    And while the US denied carrying out strikes in the area, the governor of the
    province was on camera blaming Nato forces – a common shorthand for the US, the
    only Nato member still conducting air operations in Afghanistan.\n\n> Coordinating
    an OSINT [Open Source Intelligence] operation involves setting priorities for
    different strikes – what is known already, and what’s most important to find out?
    Do we know for sure that a strike happened, or are we trying to pinpoint where
    and when?\n\n> In the Baghlan case, the key information to find was the coordinates.
    In incidents like this, where responsibility is not clear, finding the exact location
    of the strike can make a huge difference. In the strike on Masih’s house, it was
    this detail that had prompted a reversal of the US military’s initial denial.\"\n\nUsing
    Check to collectively document findings, the team of OSINT volunteers searched
    the internet to geolocate where the strike happened. One user even found evidence
    that determined the location of the strike. Others were able to help the Bureau
    build weights of information that detailed who strikes killed and when. \n\nIn
    total, the Check-supported reporting led to [this piece](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2020-06-03/finding-the-faces-of-afghanistans-slaughtered-civilians)
    examining two of the incidents and looking at how OSINT can help fill accountability
    gaps and produce leads to follow up on the ground. Another [version of the piece](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-us-military)
    appeared in WIRED. \n\nOne strike in particular, in Baghlan province on July 9,
    outlined the technical process for verification in this Bellingcat [case study](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2020/06/04/investigating-one-case-of-civilian-harm-in-afghanistan/).
    \n\nOSINT findings also [fed into this long read](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2020-06-03/the-families-paying-the-price-for-the-war-in-afghanistan),
    examining accountability for the airwar in Afghanistan, which investigated strikes
    that hit ten civilian compounds. A number of the cases came from the Check account,
    while others are from investigations outside this project. Work on a Nangarhar
    strike is featured in an [Al Jazeera Fault Lines documentary](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/faultlines/2020/06/afghanistan-civilian-loss-air-war-200602093444066.html).
    The film crew journeyed to meet this family in Afghanistan, and others in partnership
    with TBIJ. \n\nThis case study is an example of how the open source community
    can use [Check](https://checkmedia.org/) to document important information, especially
    when that information is not accessible due to lack of transparency or resource.
    On the platform, volunteers from all walks of life, coupled with a rigorous layer
    of verification by the Bureau, helped shine a light on murky incidents of war
    that greatly impacted families, homes and livelihoods."

  body: "Meedan is excited to announce a new collaboration with Facebook Journalism
    Project that will train the next generation of fact-checkers to verify health
    misinformation for their global audiences. \n\nThe initiative, a year-long [global
    health fellowship](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship)
    facilitated by Facebook, will bring on new team members to 10 participating fact-checking
    organizations. Fellows selected by the 10 participating fact-checking organizations
    will take part in virtual training sessions provided by Meedan and Facebook. \n\nMeedan
    will support these fact-checkers with critical training on the ethics, standards
    and core practices for debunking health misinformation worldwide. \n\nThe COVID-19
    pandemic shines a light on the critical need to support the capacity and skills
    that are necessary to successfully fact-check claims about complex science surrounding
    treatments, causes, cures, homeopathic remedies and vaccines. Health misinformation
    is running rampant on online platforms and there is great need for the next generation
    of journalists to understand how health literacy and health barriers contribute
    to the spread of disease, and how responsible fact-checking and verification efforts
    can be foundational pillars in the equalization of access to high quality health
    news. \n\nMeedan will collaborate on the Facebook training by working with our
    [in-house experts](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/)
    on developing a curriculum that helps fact-checkers navigate complex health debunking
    tasks in ways that are responsible. We’re so excited to be able to contribute
    to this project and to work with organizations including: \n\n- Tempo, Indonesia\n-
    Vera Files, Phillippines\n- Factly, India\n- The Quint, India\n- ColombiaCheck,
    Colombia\n- La Silla Vacía, Colombia\n- Africa Check, South Africa\n- Teyit, Turkey\n-
    Pagella Politica, Italy\n- Full Fact, UK\n\nThis training will be another addition
    to our suite of COVID-19 resource-building, which already includes our public
    health information tool, [learnaboutcovid19.org](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/).
    It will also be our second training project this year, preceded by the roll out
    of [Google News Initiative-supported curriculum](https://meedan.com/blog/training-the-next-workforce-to-field-dangerous-claims/)
    that is being delivered across nine countries. \n\nMore details to come soon!

  body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
    health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached 700,000
    of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
    Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
    based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
    where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests made
    by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may also have—
    we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information online more
    efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where searching takes
    place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible team of experts
    __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the scientific research
    __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully reached an audience
    of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North
    America__, with localization of both text and accompanying visuals (thanks, to
    [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/) and [Localization
    Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/)) __in 8 languages__ prioritized by our
    partners \n- The __public health community__, including health literacy practitioners,
    __is eager and excited to get more involved__ in supporting local misinformation
    response efforts\n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-reuters](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4xgsZVcR02vLjnusBejbyo/189a7297d4d3b38964e5219f5af26ee4/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-reuters.jpg)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Reporting done by Reuters about herd immunity and COVID-19 using
    Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough the
    COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to reduced
    availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides with public
    health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking organizations
    with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health misinformation,
    especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated in about
    health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science, Engineering
    and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
    health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
    and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the Robert
    Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
    to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
    Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
    for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community information
    leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online across literacy
    levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate with behavior
    scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and educational modules
    to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation response efforts. \n\nOur
    COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
    is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
    fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
    leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
    health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
    disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
    and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
    and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
    as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
    Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
    as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
    explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations; sharing
    recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and journalists
    to review as they produce the information their communities need. \n\nThis content

    expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct communication
    channels involves developing interventions where target audiences spend time finding
    answers to the health questions they have, which today means content easily encountered
    through searches online and through social media. Of course, as any one organization,
    this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring this project, we developed a
    process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the fact-checkers fact-check. It was
    our hope that by building a model based on syndication, fact-checkers, journalists
    and other community information leaders can use the content we create directly
    for them *__as well as__* the content we have developed in response to questions
    shared by other communicators. With this model, we can provide the needed health
    expertise to reduce health misinformation more efficiently, at larger scales,
    and directly where a users’ searching takes place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

    class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
    Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
    topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
    focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
    to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and therefore
    the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The examples of
    where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the world have led
    to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight the impact that
    smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse online when
    we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints for the
    triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest challenges
    of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the speed of the
    internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google Design, and
    others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework that ensures
    the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated, networked
    impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__ To date, a
    small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease, nutritional
    epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health behavior change
    have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks. Each article or
    database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers and journalists,
    with additional information to further distill  each topic’s historical and scientific
    significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact will soon be magnified
    through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting 8 languages prioritized
    by our current partners. We are currently working with SciLine to expand the global
    reach of the resources that they have created by including them in the short articles
    we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__ Through the syndication model
    developed for this project, our partners have identified an audience of over 700,000
    people in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and
    North America. This audience includes podcast listeners, website visitors and
    newsletter subscribers, and does not include the social media followings of our
    partner organizations. This level of impact was made possible through our syndication
    model for content dissemination, enabling a small team of scientists, researchers
    and communicators to influence diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround
    time for the content we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial
    cycles of our journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5
    hours by team members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response
    directly targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
    based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often when
    expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
    misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
    into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
    sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
    Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number of
    requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse set
    of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across a variety
    of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the last 6 months\n\nAs
    a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our project strategy forward:
    \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals about the value of existing
    approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the impact of misinformation.__
    Influencing impacts of health misinformation at scale requires closer connections
    between health scientists and communicators using tools already optimized for
    easy online encounters with factual health information, such as Google’s ClaimReview
    and MediaReview annotation frameworks,, and partnerships with third-party fact-checking
    organizations. The health community is ready and excited to contribute to projects
    like this one, and needs guidance about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2.
    __Syndication models can maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships
    with e-newsletters, podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models,
    and collaborations with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached
    over 700,000 people in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue
    supporting communicators with their own content development, know that while we
    can distill the ever-changing science successfully, community information leaders
    know their audiences best, and that maximizes the impact of any public health
    message.  \n\n3. __A focus is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines
    and treatment.__ While these represent the majority of the questions shared with
    us by fact-checkers and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected
    in resources provided by intergovernmental or government health institutions.
    Further, while current public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine
    will be developed by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start
    by early 2021, a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness
    to get vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus
    uneven eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the
    elimination of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is
    essential to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation
    associated with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier
    than the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
    is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
    scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
    combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
    local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
    expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
    This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability, relevance,
    and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating in diverse
    languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health literacy where
    their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding and diversifying
    our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next for our team: \n\n__Expanding
    scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided contextualization for over
    120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate of, on average, 10 database articles
    or “entries” per week. Our collaborators are increasingly asking questions about
    public health topics significant with respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly
    relevant outside of COVID-19. These include questions about nutrition, non-communicable
    diseases, antibiotic resistance and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide
    additional public health expert contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.
    \ \n\n__Engaging with community-based communications networks:__ Our goal is to
    expand our offerings with a focus on rapid responses for community newsrooms,
    freelance journalists, community  nonprofits and other information leaders within
    communities. In collaboration with our partners, we’re working with the product
    and development teams at Meedan to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing
    between our experts and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines
    through SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot
    infrastructure so community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences
    with the health information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope
    to support these groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor
    to the needs of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening
    relationships between public health experts, the health literacy community, local
    newsrooms and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community
    newsrooms and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
    via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with the
    public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales larger
    than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

  body: "Over the past few years, Meedan has grown significantly, expanding to three
    major programs — [Check Global](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/), the
    [WhatsApp 3PFC project](https://meedan.com/check) and the [Digital Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/)
    — alongside our existing initiatives such as the [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/),
    [Pop Up Newsroom](https://popup.news/), the [Content Moderation Project](https://meedan.com/projects)
    and our ongoing trainings. With this growth comes a need for more operational
    infrastructural support. We're thrilled to welcome Gisela Zuniga to the team as
    our new executive associate, supporting our operational and administrative work
    throughout the organization. She brings her skills as a communicator to the team
    as well, having already helped us run two events and revamping our communications
    strategy. \n\nHere's a short Q&A where we spend some time getting to know Gisela
    and welcoming her to the team!\n\n### 1. What has been your experience before
    you joined Meedan?\n\nI studied filmmaking and cultural studies for undergrad
    in New York; during this time, I completed internships about archiving activist
    artwork, museum programming, and media nonprofit development. After graduating,
    I joined the independent media outlet Neta in my hometown of McAllen, Texas, focused
    on sharing grassroots narratives about the U.S.-Mexico border. I first joined
    as a video journalist, and transitioned to creative strategy, taking on additional
    freelance work in documentary film and mixed reality projects in both Texas and
    New York. I'm a member of [Brown Girls Doc Mafia](https://www.browngirlsdocmafia.com/),
    a global women of color filmmakers group, and do art residencies occasionally.\n\n###
    2. Tell us about a journalism project that you worked on that was exciting and
    insightful.\n\nWhile at Neta, I produced a video about low-income residents of
    Texas border towns organizing to install public lighting in colonias. Colonias,
    or unincorporated settlements of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans, often
    don't have access to sanitation or other city services like the streetlights many
    of us take for granted. We collaborated with local civic rights organization [ARISE](http://www.arisesotex.org/),
    led by the headstrong women of these colonias, to develop the Spanish-language
    script and create a digital landing page for this video guide. We got to present
    this collaborative project in city hall to local legislators, and since then many
    more colonias have been able to get public lighting installed!\n\n![Alumbrado

    class=\"caption\">November 6, 2018. A 6-year-old girl plays in the streets as
    the sun sets, before her neighborhood goes completely dark. This colonia in Alamo,
    Texas awaits installation of public lights scheduled for January 2019.</p>\n\n###
    3. What is the local news media ecosystem like in the US? What are the strengths
    and what gaps do you see?\n\nBased on my experience, the U.S. local news media
    ecosystem is fundamental to how we understand our lives as community members in
    our town/state/region in a way distinct from national coverage. However, local
    news has been set up to fail by investment capital, corporate influence, and the
    scarcity of sustainable funding models, creating massive gaps for meaningful growth.
    Its strength lies in the resistance of its journalists to imagine a better industry
    and the incredible organizing to bring it to life. Groups like [Study Hall](https://studyhall.xyz/)
    create national dialogues for workers across individual contexts to share resources,
    and [Press On Media](https://www.presson.media/) and [Migrant Roots Media](https://www.migrantrootsmedia.org/)
    has done incredible work organizing U.S. Southern BIPOC-led local outlets to connect
    and build a better industry together.\n\n### 4. What brought you to Meedan?\n\nI
    have become increasingly curious about the tech world and its intersection with
    media over the years. While my introduction to this field has been through creative
    technology applications, I've been voraciously learning as much as I can about
    emerging tools to imagine and implement a more just world. Given Meedan's work
    to support fact-checkers worldwide via open-source tool Check, to cultivate the
    sustainability of independent media organizations via the Check Global program,
    and to explore cutting-edge research in AI technology, joining the Meedan team
    felt like the natural next step in my career.\n\n### 5. What skills are you hoping
    to grow at Meedan?\n\nI'm hoping to strengthen my skills in operations management,
    nonprofit development, and to learn more about nuances of the tech industry. My
    past experience working in the arts and media emphasized to me that the way colleagues
    work and communicate with one another is just as vital as the quality of the actual
    product made. Learning how to craft systems that affirm team members, establish
    clear expectations for workflows, and cultivate a culture of care within management
    dynamics not only strengthens my own systems thinking skills, but empowers me
    to envision what a better tech and media world might look like and bring it to
    life.\n\n### 6. Tell us some fun facts about Gisela.\n\n-   Buffy the Vampire
    Slayer is my favorite TV show!\n-   Favorite food is *poc chuc*, a Yucatecan Maya
    dish of grilled pork chops marinated with sour orange and served with pickled
    red onions and avocado.\n-   I think the best ways to get active are salsa dancing,
    roller skating, and taekwondo.\n-   I'm a U.S. Southerner of the Mexican and Honduran
    diaspora, and call the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas home."

  body: "On Thursday, Oct. 1, U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump
    reported positive diagnoses of COVID-19. The story is still developing, and a
    lot of information—both scientific and political—is still unknown. Meedan’s team
    of in-house public health experts at learnaboutcovid19.org have explainers that
    can help support your reporting on this breaking news event. We’ll update this
    with more resources as more information becomes available and clear.\n\n#### [How
    many days after exposure should one be tested to yield the most accurate results,
    and with which test?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/how-many-days-after-exposure-should-one-be-tested-to-yield-the-most-accurate-results-and-with-which-test/)\n\nOn
    Oct. 2, 2020 press reported that former Vice President and presidential hopeful
    Joe Biden tested negative for COVID-19 after his exposure to President Trump during
    the first 2020 presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020. Research suggests that diagnostic
    testing is more accurate a few days after symptoms start, or around a week after
    exposure to a person who is infected with COVID-19. Testing more than once can
    also confirm negative results. Testing Vice President Biden more than once would
    be the best way to ensure confirmation that he is COVID-19 free. The Biden campaign
    has said on record that Biden and his team are tested regularly for the virus.
    \ \n\n#### [When do we consider someone with COVID-19 to have recovered?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/when-do-we-consider-someone-with-covid-19-to-have-recovered/)\n\nThis
    is a question that will impact the final weeks of the presidential campaign. A
    review of COVID-19 recovery guidelines being used around the world show most doctors
    agree on the following criteria: 1) Clinical: The patient no longer has symptoms,
    and 2) Laboratory: The patient has negative test results (testing through swabs
    taken from the nose and throat) showing the virus is no longer present in the
    upper respiratory system. Both of these criteria should be considered in combination
    to determine recovery. Negative test results are important because people can
    still spread the virus even if they have no symptoms or their symptoms have stopped.
    It remains to be seen how these types of criteria will be implemented amid campaign
    efforts. \n\n#### [Can someone be infected with COVID-19 more than once?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/can-someone-be-infected-with-covid-19-more-than-once/)\n\nMedia
    [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barrett-coronavirus-court-trump/2020/10/02/ecf7c7ce-04cf-11eb-8879-7663b816bfa5_story.html)
    that Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett tested positive for COVID-19
    earlier in 2020 but then recovered. Barrett has met with senators and the president
    in recent days to discuss her nomination. Can Barrett be reinfected? Our scientists
    say that regardless of the anecdotal evidence, experts still do not know for sure
    if people can become infected with COVID-19 a second time, but it appears to be
    possible. More evidence is needed to determine whether or not reinfection can
    occur in patients, how common it is, and what kind of immunity to the virus people
    might obtain once they have been infected.\n\n#### [Are you as likely to die from
    a common cold as COVID-19?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/are-you-as-likely-to-die-from-a-common-cold-as-covid-19/)\n\nThe
    president is reported to have mild cold-like symptoms at the time of writing this
    roundup. While symptoms of the common cold can be similar to COVID-19, there are
    some clear differences in the potential severity of the two diseases. Namely,
    COVID-19 is far more lethal than the virus that causes the common cold, even though
    the vast majority of COVID-19 patients only experience mild or no symptoms. The
    president’s COVID-19 diagnosis does remain mild, according to White House reports.
    \n\n#### [What would successful contact tracing look like following the President
    of the United States’ COVID-19 infection?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-would-successful-contact-tracing-look-like-following-the-president-of-the-united-states-covid-19-infection/)\n\nContact
    tracing is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. It’s
    a process that involves tracking down the contacts of any person that tests positive
    for the disease, so that those contacts can themselves get tested and/or isolate
    themselves to stop further spread. Many news reports are currently outlining the
    President’s many points of contact with individuals at rallies, events and interactions
    with supporters and donors. This entry outlines what will be involved in chasing
    down those contacts to ensure further spread can stop before it starts. \n\n####
    [What does the science say about COVID-19 on surfaces?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-does-the-science-say-about-covid-19-on-surfaces/)\n\nDays
    before his diagnosis, President Trump was seen throwing hats into a crowd at a
    campaign event. Video footage of him doing that is now being reported by multiple
    major media outlets in light of his positive test result. What do we know so far
    about COVID-19 on surfaces, including hats? The virus that causes COVID-19 primarily
    spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface contamination.
    However, if a person touches a contaminated surface with traces of the virus and
    then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could become infected if the surface
    contains large amounts of the virus. \n\nThis is why it is important to clean
    and disinfect any surfaces that people might come into contact with, especially
    those like doorknobs, cell phones, light switches, handles, countertops, sinks,
    toilets, and more. If possible, people should try to avoid touching high-contact
    surfaces in public. Washing your hands for 20 seconds, avoiding touching your
    face, maintaining six feet (two meters) of distance and wearing a mask are key
    steps in combatting the spread of the virus.\n\n#### [What is the difference between
    exposure and infection to a virus?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-exposure-and-infection-to-a-virus/)\n\nThe
    president and his aides shared rooms and outdoor spaces with many people in the
    days leading up to the announcement of his COVID-19 infection. There are key differences
    between being exposed to the virus, and being infected with it. In this entry,
    we outline where exposure stops, and infection begins. In short, when it comes
    to infectious diseases, “exposure” means coming into contact with a virus or bacteria.
    Infection happens when someone is exposed and actually becomes sick from the exposure.
    \n\n#### [What short and long-term effects does COVID-19 have on other body parts,
    including lungs, brain, heart and kidneys?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-short-and-long-term-effects-does-covid-19-have-on-other-body-parts-including-lungs-brain-heart-and-kidneys/)\n\nSome
    health experts are concerned that the president’s age and his weight put him in
    a category of people that are most likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19.
    This is because the disease can attack not just a person’s respiratory system
    but also their heart, brain and other organs. This entry outlines some of the
    impacts, short-term and long, that COVID-19 patients experience. In more severe
    cases of the disease, symptoms can impact several organs. These include pulmonary
    embolisms (lungs), strokes (brain), and kidney damage due to a lack of oxygen
    or blood clots.  Often the disease’s symptoms are mild and resolve within a couple
    of weeks, but sometimes they can be more severe. \n\n[What do we know about monoclonal
    antibodies as part of a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-do-we-know-about-monoclonal-antibodies-as-part-of-a-treatment-or-vaccine-for-covid-19/)\n\nWhile
    he was in the hospital, President Trump received an experimental monoclonal antibody
    cocktail from Regeneron as part of his COVID-19 treatment. What *is* a monoclonal
    antibody? Our scientists write that monoclonal antibodies (which means ‘one type
    of antibody’) are antibodies created in a lab that can act as a replacement for
    the antibodies the body normally creates. The difference between these lab-made
    antibodies and those created by the immune system is that the monoclonal types
    are uniquely designed to target a specific antigen, in this case the virus that
    causes COVID-19, so it can send it messages, try to destroy it, and even make
    it easier for the immune system to find the antigen and attack it."

  body: "On October 5, 2020, Meedan gathered scientists and local news journalists
    in the United States to talk about how the pandemic is shaping their work. \n\nWith
    the first nine months of the pandemic behind us, and in anticipation of a second
    wave this fall, we aimed for the discussion to serve as an opportunity to reflect
    on how local news reporting fared during the early stages of this global crisis.
    We also worked together to design new paths forward for scientists and journalists
    as reporting needs increase around emerging treatments, vaccines and projected
    upticks in transmission.\n\nOur panelists included:\n\n- Anna Kuchment, science
    reporter at Dallas Morning News and contributing editor at Scientific American\n\n-
    Madeleine Bair, founder and publisher El El Tímpano \n\n- Dr. Christin Gilmer,
    global health expert and science lead of learnaboutcovid19.org\n\n- Dr. Jessica
    Huang, COVID-19 response and recovery fellow, Harvard Kennedy School, and health
    literacy researcher for learnaboutcovid19.org\n\nHere are five takeaways from
    the event: \n\n1. Many journalists without science backgrounds are now expected
    to cover complex topics like epidemiology and public health without formal experience
    or training. Finding trusted sources, translating jargon into accessible terms
    and trying to remain up to date on emerging research contributes to information
    overload for reporters. \n\n2. It's hard to know who to trust when traditional
    agencies are not reliable sources of information. It means information  chaos,
    and reporters trying to come up with strategies to maintain trust without the
    help of the U.S. government.\n\n3. Confined to reporting over Zoom, local journalists
    say that connecting with sources, telling visually compelling stories, and conveying
    emotion in a raw way is hard when they can't interview in person.\n\n4. Public
    health experts are overwhelmed by the incoming requests from media during the
    pandemic, and solutions toward scaling their information dissemination are needed.
    \n\n5. Scientists and journalists want more interaction and conversation between
    their fields. Local reporters sometimes get missed during big news events, and
    town hall-style forums could help scientists share new angles and ideas with reporters.\n\nMeedan's
    COVID-19 Expert Database, also known as learnaboutcovid19.org, is a hub where
    journalists ask our in-house health experts to explain complex science on deadline.
    We're working toward building more resources to boost capacity of U.S. local newsrooms
    as the second wave of the pandemic looms upon us and reporting needs around health
    topics increase. If you're a journalist, email us at health@meedan.com to get
    your COVID-19 topics explained by a team of experts.\n"

  body: |-
    We recently attended the APAC Trusted Media Summit organised by First Draft, the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter and the Google News Initiative on October 1-2, 2020. In the two-day virtual summit, fact-checkers, journalists and technologists shared their experiences and insights on combating misinformation amid a pandemic. The conference platform, Hopin, was in itself something new to grasp. Sessions, breakout sessions, comments and questions in the chat box, live booths for participant organizations, interaction with hundreds of people across time zones - everything from one's own home, made 'virtual' seem so real.

    In this short post, we're sharing five items that caught our attention.

    #### Responses to COVID-19 misinformation are responses to the ills in the society as well

    COVID-19 certainly posed an enormous task for fact-checkers and journalists. The Trusted Media Summit itself began with a reminder that health misinformation can have harms ranging from no harm to risk to life. However, misinformation surrounding the pandemic is not just on account of a mysterious virus. The rot runs deep as the fault lines of race and religion, mistrust, divisive politics and inadequate state capacities all powered the [misinfodemic](https://meedan.com/reports/2020-misinfodemic-report-covid-19-in-emerging-economies/). Fact-checkers from across Asia-Pacific flagged misinformation filled with hatred towards minorities, anti-Asian sentiments and political agendas. As the task in hand has become daunting, fact-checking is more needed than ever.

    #### Cautious but hopeful! The fact-checking world will not be caught off guard with vaccine misinformation

    Fact-checkers have already countered tonnes of vaccine-related misinformation. However, letting down our guard can result in a twin infodemic from misinformation on COVID and vaccines. The vaccination drive has to heed challenges such as politicized rollout, difficulties in vaccinating different age groups and communities and  dropout risks. Amid these challenges, an infodemic can prove costly. Greater vaccine awareness, reliable information channels, and trust are crucial.

    #### Regulations on data protection often come at the cost of freedom of expression and transparency

    Governments now understand the need to tackle misinformation, but focus only on misinformation by third-parties passing the buck on misinformation stemming from governments themselves. As more and more governments adopt regulations on data protection, internet content and digital security, lack of clear definitions can raise threats to freedom of expression and harassment of journalists. When platforms and governments adopt content moderation, there is a need for greater transparency and public records of the actions taken.

    #### Trauma and mental health issues are real

    Fact-checkers and journalists are at the receiving end of online harassment and trolling. They are also exposed to disturbing and graphic content. The pandemic has only added to the moral distress, work pressure and uncertainties. For some journalists, the pandemic has become very personal as it affected journalists and their families and friends directly. While many of us have the option of turning off the news or taking a break from social media, this isn't an option for fact-checkers. Apart from resilience strategies for individuals, organizations need legal support and training on online safety. As political pressures also mount, international networks and support are crucial.

    #### Fact-checkers need to look out for misinformation in the digital marketing space

    Misinformation keeps evolving in its tactics and forms. One heads up for the fact-check community is misinformation in the e-commerce and digital marketing space. E-commerce hoaxes, PR firms running pro and anti candidate campaigns for elections, crowdsourcing and renting Facebook accounts for running massive ad campaigns, were among the items discussed at the summit.

  body: "On October 16, 2020, Meedan organized an event to discuss election reporting
    and integrity in the backdrop of upcoming elections in the United States on November
    3 and in Myanmar on November 8, 2020. Journalists from these countries face  enormous
    challenges of reporting amidst multiple crises of COVID-19 pandemic, internet
    shutdown, misuse of popular social media platforms, historic wildfires and vaccines
    in development. \n\nThough not under the same circumstances, elections in other
    countries in 2018 and 2019 saw journalists and fact-checkers report amid massive
    social and political change. To learn from the experiences of journalists who
    have covered elections recently, we were joined by \n\n- [Ellen T.Tordesillas](https://twitter.com/tordesillas),
    Trustee and writer at[ VERA Files](https://verafiles.org/), a group that undertakes
    in-depth reporting on current issues.and is a third-party fact-checker for Facebook
    in the Philippines\n- [Jency Jacob](https://twitter.com/jencyjac), Managing Editor
    of [BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in/), India's premier fact-checking digital initiative\n-
    [Summer Chen](https://twitter.com/SummerLake), Chief Editor of[ Taiwan FactCheck
    Center](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/) (TFC). TFC has been leading the battle against
    misinformation related to COVID-19 and the presidential elections in Taiwan.\n-
    [Sean Ndlovu](https://twitter.com/seanndlovu), co-founder and innovation and research
    manager at [[CITE](https://cite.org.zw/)],  a Zimbabwean community space and incubator
    for innovators, technologists and journalists. \n\nThe session was moderated by
    [Monika Bauerlein](https://twitter.com/MonikaBauerlein), [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/)'
    chief executive officer. \nThe session was organized by Shalini Joshi, Megan Marrelli
    and Nat Gyenes. \n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube\"

    autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\nHere
    are some insights from the discussion: \n\n#### Misinformation and disinformation
    campaigns are attacks on democracy. \n\nElection misinformation poses serious
    threats to the integrity of elections and legitimacy of institutions in countries.
    Unproven claims on electronic voting machines being tampered in India, false claims
    of polling booths shut down in Zimbabwe and wrong claims of election fraud in
    Taiwan - election integrity has come under threat repeatedly in the past few years. \n\n>
    \"During this year's Taiwan election, their biggest challenge was misinformation
    about election fraud, especially through LINE, raising doubt in voting systems.\"
    - Summer Chen\n\n#### Multiple crises amid elections made combating election misinformation
    more challenging.  \n\nFact-checkers were prepared to combat election misinformation,
    but did not anticipate the scale of which it struck due to the multiple crises
    that emerged. If in India it was a terrorist attack, in Taiwan it was the COVID-19
    pandemic. \n\n> \"We were always working towards the 2019 general elections in
    India. But none of us bargained for what was going to happen in the months prior
    to the election. The Pulwama terrorist attack that killed over 40 paramilitary
    personnel and a near war situation between India and Pakistan completely changed
    the tone of the election.\" - Jency Jacob\n\n#### Misinformation comes from multiple
    sources and often in orchestrated manners.\n\nAs more and more people become part
    of the digital world, elections are not determined solely by ground politics.
    Social media wings of political parties engage in virtual battles to swing votes
    and conduct smear campaigns with the aid of faceless users running Twitter profiles
    and Facebook pages.  Countries also face orchestrated misinformation attacks which
    can be traced to external actors attempting to destabilize governments and elections. \n\n####
    Elections are trying times for fact-checkers, but commitment and the impact of
    their work keep them going. \n\n> \"Through the challenge of disinformation, we're
    positive, because audiences have noticed it is an issue. They care.\" - Summer
    Chen\n\n> \"The fact that there's so much to do is what keeps us going.\" - Ellen
    Tordesillas\n\n> \"We need collaboration, collaboration and collaboration to address
    election disinformation.\" - Sean Ndlovu\n\n> \"Before 2017, no fact-checkers
    existed in India. If you would Google a rumor, you would generally not have any
    reporting on it. Now, we have more than 15 fact-checking organizations across
    the country. An ecosystem of fact-checkers increases the potential for users to
    encounter quality information & fact-checks.\" - Jency Jacob"

  body: "Since October 2019, Meedan has run a [global fact-checking project](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)
    using the WhatsApp Business API and powered by [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
    an open-source platform built by Meedan. During the year, we entered into new
    and exciting partnerships with fact-checking groups and newsrooms across the globe
    to combat misinformation. As a community, we have made huge strides and learned
    from each other. \n\nStarting this month, we will speak to members of our partner
    organizations about their fact-checking experiences and their vision for the future.
    Here, we present the first interview of the series with Kritika Goel, Associate
    Editor at the Quint. \n\nKritika leads [WebQoof](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof),
    an independent fact-checking initiative of [The Quint](https://www.thequint.com/).
    According to Urban dictionary, WebQoof means someone who believes every word or
    information on the Internet and social media. We have been working with Kritika
    for the past five months and have found in her a passionate fact-checker, someone
    who gives honest feedback and is willing to take up new challenges. It has been
    a pleasure working with Kritika, one of the women leaders in the fact-check community.\n\n###
    How long have you been a fact-checker? What has been your experience before becoming
    one? What brought you to this?\n\nI started full time fact-checking in June 2019.
    Before that I was a  desk reporter and a part-time fact-checker. \n\nBut with
    every news break, I also saw a parallel narrative, shared on  social media and
    sometimes by mainstream news channels. This information, in some cases, was unverifiable
    and had no source. I just wanted to go to the root of the problem and understand
    where it is coming from. As a journalist we are taught to ask questions. For me
    an important question was -  what is the source of the information? Most of the
    time, there was no answer. It was after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, that I shifted
    to full-time fact-checking. \n\n### What is the Indian media and fact-checking
    ecosystem like? What are the strengths and what gaps do you see?\n\nIn India,
    there were smaller and independent fact-checking organizations like [Alt News](https://www.altnews.in/),
    [BOOM ](https://www.boomlive.in/)and [SM Hoax Slayer](https://smhoaxslayer.com/).
    Now we even have the mainstream media in this space. \n\nThere is a need for greater
    collaboration and resource sharing. We know that misinformation travels more widely
    and faster than fact-checks. If a viral piece of content is consumed by 100,000
    people, are even 10% consuming the fact-checks? The motive is to amplify fact-checks
    and reach a wider audience. Only then we can combat misinformation. The idea is
    not to push out a story and to say that we have done a fact-check, but for people
    to get the right information. For that, there should be collaboration between
    fact-checkers, which is happening, but  should be at a bigger scale. There was
    a [ global collaboration under the International Fact Check Network](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/?covid_countries=0&covid_rating=0&covid_fact_checkers=47485)
    for tackling COVID-19 related misinformation. I was able to fact-check two-three
    pieces of misinformation, including a video which was viral in India, but was
    originally from Taiwan by reaching out to [Summer Chen](https://twitter.com/SummerLake)
    of [Taiwan FactCheck Center](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/). So, collaboration really
    helps. \n\nCollaboration in distribution can also help in reaching a wider audience.
    For instance, The Quint has a certain audience and Alt News has another. Together,
    we reach a larger audience. When WebQoof started we used to reproduce content
    from BOOM, Alt and SM Hoax slayer, which helped in amplifying the reach of the
    content. I am sure that we can come up with better ways and see how fact-check
    content can reach a wider audience. \n\n### How important would you say is fact-checking
    in the current times? Do you see a real impact with the stories and fact-checking
    work you do?\n\nThere definitely is a need for fact-checking. It has become another
    branch of journalism.\n\nIn terms of impact, there is an alert audience who flags
    and identifies misinformation. Recently, we got in touch with individuals who
    tag us and other fact-checkers regularly on Twitter to flag misinformation. When
    we reply with the fact-check, they share it with others. They are like volunteers;
    by sharing verified information with their networks, they are amplifying the distribution
    and helping facts reach a wider audience. That is an impact for me and to highlight
    such contributions we did a [story on these citizen fact-checkers](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/how-citizens-joined-fact-checkers-in-the-fight-against-fake-news). \n\nWe
    have done so many stories on mainstream media sharing false information. They
    do not always acknowledge that there has been a mistake or issue a clarification,
    while they also have fact-check verticals. The fact that the mainstream media,
    including us, has fact-check verticals is itself an impact. Media organizations
    have realized that the audience is interested in facts and not just narratives
    and whataboutery. This is an impact brought about by the entire fact-checking
    community. \n\n### What is your most challenging fact-check experience and how
    did you work on it?\n\nThe recent amendment of [the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA)](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/citizenship-amendment-act-2019-all-you-need-to-know-11576401546515.html) 
    in India was followed by protests in many parts of the country. The Jamia Millia
    Islamia University became the centre of protests with clashes between pro and
    anti CAA student groups and heavy deployment of police forces. During this episode,
    there were claims that a  member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP),
    the student wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, was seen exiting the university
    compound wearing a police gear.This was used to claim that the government and
    police were not doing their job and were involved in the violence inside the campus.
    However, the person was a cop in civilian clothes wearing a gear. \n\nWe got in
    touch with the ABVP member who was misidentified, the concerned cop and the people
    who were around when the incident took place. Luckily we had reporters on the
    ground. But, it took us over a day to speak to the cop in concern, to reach out
    to people and also to verify if what they said is the truth or not. It was very
    difficult at that point. \n\nWe could not take anybody at face value and had to
    verify everything to make sure that they were telling us the truth. During this
    time, there were also other social media posts misidentifying people. So, this
    was an important [story ](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/did-abvp-member-attack-protesting-students-disguised-as-cop-fact-check)to
    do at that point. Four of our team members were involved in the story and we wanted
    it to be watertight.\n\nAs a fact-checker and journalist, my biggest nightmare
    is what if we verify a piece of information based on inputs from an individual
    and they aren't telling us the truth? So, I do not take anything at face value
    and look for evidence to put forth the facts. \n\n### You recently took charge
    of Quint's fact-check team. How is the new experience and what are your plans
    for the team?\n\nI have been working with WebQoof for over a year. Since my senior
    editor moved on, I have the new responsibility of leading the team. It is definitely
    exciting as there is a lot happening in the misinformation space.\n\nAn important
    strategy for me is to do more ground reports so that we can bring out the truth
    and put forth the facts from the ground.\n\nSince the beginning of my work at
    WebQoof, I have been interested in media literacy. Once you empower the reader,
    it will help in expanding the community. An individual can be a fact-checker in
    their family and friends WhatsApp groups. Many of us started off like that.\n\nWe
    also intend to do a lot more in the health fact-checking space . The pandemic 
    has really shown how prevalent and detrimental health misinformation is. After
    the COVID-19 outbreak, we are receiving more fact-check requests on general health
    misinformation as well. So the key focus areas for me would be: Media literacy,
    more ground reports and focus on health misinformation. \n\n### How do you deal
    with the pressure in having to respond to misinformation on a daily basis and
    even come across some distressing content?\n\nFor the longest time, I thought
    I was immune to violent and graphic content and did not get impacted. But there
    are days when we have to look at gory images, blood, violence all day; I think
    why is there so much hatred and violence? There are really distressing videos
    where you see people thrash and hurt each other. \n\nSometimes, it does not affect
    me. But, I also keep chatting with my team members, because there are people who
    get really impacted and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a real thing. \n\nOnce
    my team member said, \"I go back home, I just think about these'. Sometimes we
    want that choice to not look at distressing content. There are days when you feel
    low because of it. I wish we had a choice, but it is part of the job of a fact-checker. \n\nI
    speak to my team very  proactively; we are a bunch of young people and we understand
    each other well. There are days when you should take a step back and not look
    at content that is disturbing. I was lucky to have a senior editor who took note
    of all this and made sure we were not too overwhelmed (for the want of a better
    work) with the kind of content we are engaging with. But yes, I think there is
    a need to have this conversation and I hope as a team, we are able to understand
    this better moving forward. \n\n### What do you think works the most to stop people
    from sharing misinformation and build a culture of verifying information - stories,
    videos or broader interventions like media literacy?\n\nEven if we can develop
    a habit of asking what is the source of the information, I think we will go a
    long way. When I joined WebQoof, I had fears of how I would be able to do it and
    identify misinformation. We are taught tools, but verifying content does not come
    instantly. The biggest lesson I taught myself was to question the source. If you
    know where the claim is coming from, you can go ahead and verify that. \n\nCreating
    awareness about being able to verify and to forward suspicious content to fact-checkers
    is important. \n\nIn terms of format, videos travel faster and they travel more.
    At WebQoof we produce a lot of videos, including video explainers. \n\n### How
    has been your experience of using Check? What else would you like the tool to
    do for you?\n\nThe experience has been good so far. I really like that we now
    have data on how many people are engaging with the bot and resources. This is
    a good way to know how useful it is. \n\nShalini and Pierre initially told us
    that it is important to sometimes engage with the reader. As quereis have gone
    up, that does not happen often. We intend to do that more often. When requests
    are out of scope for fact-check, we inform the user and ask them to send any forwards
    which they are doubtful of. This engagement helps in  building trust. \n\nAll
    the constant feedback in weekly calls really helps. Initially, I was not sure
    of the weekly calls. But they have been extremely good at raising issues and streamlining
    the process. \n\nWe have requested for a feature to know once a user receives
    a report we sent, in other words a confirmation. We hope to see that soon. (This
    feature has been implemented by Meedan since this interview was held).\n\nConstant
    feedback and communication are really helpful. Intercom is also helpful to immediately
    flag the issue.  After a day I may not remember it or will not have the link of
    the item. If I send the issue and the URL of the item, I know that I will receive
    a response in some time. \n\n### What kind of misinformation do you foresee in
    the post-covid world? What support do you expect from international fact-check
    communities and technology partners like us?\n\nAccess to more data about the
    kind of work we are doing is an expectation that I have from all technology partners.
    And probably, not just our work but the impact that fact-checking community has
    had will be good to understand. In my opinion, that will help in shaping our future
    goals (as a community). \n\nWe work with Facebook, Meedan and I think it will
    be helpful to know if our efforts of combating misinformation are translating
    into action. Insights on whether people are engaging more with fact-checked content,
    whether they want more verified news and what is the level of trust they have
    in fact-checkers. These will be very helpful going forward. \n\n### What is your
    vision and hopes for journalism and the world in a post- pandemic world?\n\nI
    wish we have days where we look for misinformation and do not find them. Even
    if I can't wish for a world without misinformation, I definitely hope that people
    verify information before they share it. \n\nMy hope for journalism is that mainstream
    media becomes more responsible. There needs to be more responsibility and accountability
    for information that media groups put out. It is important because [misinformation
    has real life consequences](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/impact-of-fake-news-on-lives-of-people-in-2019). \n\nWhen
    they publish unverified information, it creates a narrative that sometimes becomes
    difficult to verify or disprove. If something is unverifiable and just a narrative
    that has been weaved, I may not be able to touch it or put out a story on it or
    tell people whether it is true or not. When news is unverifiable, it tends to
    create a parallel narrative. This can result in hate speech and violence. \n\nPeople
    need to verify, be alert and if they cannot verify, send it to us. \n\n### What
    are your interests outside of work?\n\nI like reading, but that is something every
    journalist does. I love cycling, doodling and eating a lot.\n\n--\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe

      How do fact-checking groups running WhatsApp tiplines engage with users on WhatsApp?
      How do independent fact-checkers inform audiences about their tipline service?
      How do fact-checkers ensure that their WhatsApp tipline receives relevant queries from users?

      These are questions that fact-checking groups operating WhatsApp tiplines have often encountered. The WhatsApp audience is different from the existing audience on other social media platforms. According to fact-checking groups, audiences on WhatsApp prioritise promptness of response and shareability of verification reports. So how do groups position and promote the tipline service which does just that? Here are some best practices and a few examples of campaigns to inform the WhatsApp audience and promote the tipline product. These have been launched by partners that Meedan works with as part of its pilot project that focuses on End-to-End Fact-Checking on WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Business API. The ad campaigns have been supported by Facebook Journalism Project.
  body: "While ads are critical to building an audience, they have to be used strategically
    in order to maximize their impact for an organization's fact-checking work while
    reducing unactionable content. Ultimately, we’ve learned that ads combined with
    a community engagement strategy yield the most impactful projects, balancing the
    needs of both scale and quality. \n\nHere are a few things we learned through
    previous ad campaigns:\n\n1. Images work well with ad campaigns. Keep images that
    are compelling, related to the campaign and have a strong recall. Colours, logos,
    symbols and branding should be consistent across each part of the campaign.\n\n2.
    Make sure the organization's WhatsApp tipline number is prominently displayed,
    both in text that accompanies the ad and in the image itself so that people can
    catch the messaging. \n\n3. A focused call for action works well for ads and it’s
    always a good idea to follow the news cycle while designing tipline ad campaign.
    If an organization is focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, it might be useful for
    them to specify what part of the pandemic-related misinformation can be verified
    - information related to vaccines, drugs, home remedies, lockdown related measures,
    new research, etc. Other significant news events such as elections, government
    announcements, and cyclones also result in more people sending queries to WhatsApp
    tiplines. Designing ads around these will guide WhatsApp users to send better
    and relevant submissions.  \n\n4. Ads with shorter descriptions (between 100 and
    250 characters) are likely to get more engagement than ones that are more than
    250 characters. So it’s best to have less text in an ad. \n\n5. Multimedia ads
    work well on online platforms - fun GIFs, videos, engaging visuals and memes with
    some text are all easily shareable and communicate clearly with users. \n\n6.
    Cross promotion helps build community faster. Posting ads on multiple online platforms,
    like Facebook and Instagram, is also likely to direct audiences from these platforms
    to WhatsApp tiplines. Organizations should also consider using similar graphics
    on Twitter, on their website, newsletter and public Facebook page, and other channels
    to engage existing audiences.\n\n7. Consistency in presentation helps users recall
    a brand. It’s a good idea for an organization to make style, colour palette, logos
    and fonts consistent across all their assets. For example, the WhatsApp profile
    photo of an organization's tipline should be the same as the organization's profile
    photo on Facebook or other online platforms. \n\n### Here are examples of some
    ad campaigns launched by our partners in different regions:\n\n#### AFP Checamos

  body: |
    In time for the municipal elections across Brazil this past weekend, Meedan is pleased to announce three new Brazilian partners using our Check software for fact-checking on WhatsApp. They are: [Estadão Verifica](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,estadao-verifica-lanca-novo-servico-por-whatsapp,70003506752 "Estadão Verifica"), an initiative of Estadão; [Agência Lupa](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/10/22/lupa-canal-whatsapp/ "Agência Lupa"), and [Fato ou Fake ](https://g1.globo.com/fato-ou-fake/noticia/2020/11/11/fato-ou-fake-lanca-bot-exclusivo-para-checar-conteudos-duvidosos.ghtml "Fato ou Fake"), by Globo Group. The latter initiative brings together journalists from G1, O Globo, Extra, Época, Valor, CBN, GloboNews and TV Globo.

    Check is a tool for collaborative verification and annotation of digital media, with new features customized specifically for global fact-checking organizations. It's been deployed by  AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa Check, BOOM and India Today. These organization have been using Check since October 2019 across 4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions today. Our case study on this program, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact), details the insights, field research and product features that maximized the value of the WhatsApp API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on WhatsApp's end-to-end encrypted platform.

    Natália Leal, content director at Lupa agency explains the importance of Check, “This tool expands the scope of Lupa's work, while at the same time bringing the agency closer to the public. It strengthens our monitoring of the false information environment and allows our reader another channel of communication with us. Thus, he has more access to verified information when making decisions that impact his life and society."

    And for Estadão's, editor-in-chief David Friedlander, “Fake news deceives, misinforms and creates an atmosphere of confusion. That's why professional journalism is so important. With it's checking services, Estadão is dedicated to restoring the value of correct and reliable information”.

    The new partners joined AFP Checamos, a pioneer in Brazil in the use of Check in their verification process on WhatsApp. “The tool has greatly improved the way we communicate with our WhatsApp audience,” said Maria Clara Pestre, AFP fact checker Checamos (Brazil). “Now, we can be sure that anyone who contacts us through the app will have an immediate and consistent response. At the same time, we have time to dedicate ourselves to the other steps in the verification process. ”

    We adapted our toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on their work, not on technical tasks. This allowed teams to create their own workflows inside Check.

    The platform has these main features:

    - It allows the verification teams, based on the demand of the newsroom, to create menus of interactive content (bots) using their messaging channels;
    - It imports the database of fact-checks from a journalistic organization, allowing them to send reports directly to the user of content that has already been verified.
    - It also allows the public to send content suggestion to be checked by journalists;

    For our partner organizations, the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, understand and scale the demand for specific topics and distribute important information in other messaging networks. When building these relationships, it is also an opportunity to develop interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end users to assess the behavioral impacts of fact checks.

    Check enables a publishing system to send fact verification reports to users of direct channels (tiplines) who send duplicate or similar requests. “Our goal with Check,” explained Meedan's Product Director, Pierre Conti, “is to build a human and AI system so that fact checkers can efficiently scale the demand for verification directly from the public, cut whatever just noise and thus maximize the impact of the checks. We do this to help verifiers prioritize the most relevant misinformation. ”

    \"Agência Lupa\").\n\nCheck é um sistema web de código aberto para jornalistas,
    utilizado para verificar e anotar informações on-line em investigações de fatos.
    Foi projetado especialmente para organizações globalmente distribuídas de verificação.
    Utilizando a API Comercial do WhatsApp (WhatsApp Business API), Meedan desenvolveu
    uma série de funcionalidades no software implementando uma mistura de inteligência
    artificial, interface e inovações multilíngues. O nosso bot no WhatsApp é totalmente
    personalizável e projetado para checadores e jornalistas executarem canais de
    verificação no Whatsapp (tiplines), Facebook messenger, Twitter DM e muito mais.
    \n\nA iniciativa de verificação do Grupo Globo, O Fato ou Fake, reúne jornalistas
    do G1, O Globo, Extra, Época, Valor, CBN, GloboNews e TV Globo.\n\nPara Natália
    Leal, diretora de conteúdo da agência Lupa, “Essa ferramenta amplia o alcance
    do trabalho da Lupa, e, ao mesmo tempo, aproxima a agência do público. Ela fortalece
    nosso monitoramento do ambiente de informações falsas e permite ao nosso leitor
    mais um canal de comunicação conosco. Assim, ele tem mais acesso a informações
    verificadas na hora de tomar decisões que impactam a sua vida e a sociedade”.
    \n\nJá para o editor-chefe do Estadão, David Friedlander, “As fake news enganam,
    desinformam e criam um ambiente de confusão. Por isso o jornalismo profissional
    é tão importante. Com seus serviços de checagem, ele se dedica a restabelecer
    o valor da informação correta e confiável”. \n\nOs novos parceiros se juntam a
    AFP Checamos, pioneira no Brasil a utilizar Check como ferramenta. “A ferramenta
    melhorou muito a maneira como nos comunicamos com nossa audiência no WhatsApp”,
    disse Maria Clara Pestre, verificadora de fatos da AFP Checamos (Brasil). “Agora,
    podemos ter certeza de que qualquer pessoa que entrar em contato conosco por meio
    do aplicativo terá uma resposta imediata e coerente. Ao mesmo tempo, dispomos
    de tempo para nos dedicarmos às outras etapas do processo de verificação.”\n\nUma
    redação sem preocupação com códigos de programação: nós adaptamos nosso kit de
    ferramentas para ajudar verificadores de fatos a se concentrarem no trabalho de
    checagem, e não em tarefas técnicas. Isso permitiu que as equipes criassem seus
    próprios fluxos de trabalho. A plataforma possui os seguintes recursos principais:\n\n-
    Permite que as equipes de verificação, baseadas na demanda da redação, criem menus
    de conteúdo interativo (bots) nos canais de comunicação;\n- Importa o banco de
    dados de checagens de uma organização jornalística, permitindo-lhes enviar relatórios
    a respeito de conteúdo já verificado direto ao usuário;\n- Permite que o público
    envie sugestões de conteúdo para serem checadas pelos jornalistas;\n\nPara nossas
    organizações parceiras, o bot é um canal de comunicação essencial para envolver
    seu público, dimensionar a demanda por tópicos específicos e distribuir informações
    importantes em redes de mensagens próximas. Ao construir essas relações, é também
    a oportunidade de desenvolver pesquisas interativas de monitoramento e avaliação
    com usuários finais para avaliar os impactos comportamentais das checagens de
    fatos.\n\nCheck possibilita um sistema de publicação para enviar relatórios de
    verificação de fatos aos usuários de canais diretos (tiplines) que enviarem solicitações
    duplicadas ou semelhantes. “Nosso objetivo com o Check”, explicou o Diretor de
    Produto da Meedan, Pierre Conti, “é construir um sistema humano e de IA para que
    os verificadores de fatos possam dimensionar com eficiência a demanda por verificação
    diretamente do público, cortar o que for apenas ruído e maximizar assim o impacto
    das verificações. Fazemos isso para ajudar os verificadores a priorizarem as desinformações
    mais relevantes.”\n"

    en-US: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance, the
      Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool resources
      in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health emergencies
      in Africa.
  body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information since
    the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been shared and
    viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million times on
    Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African Region
    between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the United Nations’
    Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence. \n\nA
    large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and continues
    to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday. The
    COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
    is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
    is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
    they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset of
    the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies around
    unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In health emergencies,
    misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to spread. People need proven,
    science-based facts to make informed decisions about their health and well-being,
    and a glut of information - an infodemic - with misinformation in the mix makes
    it hard to know what is right and real. This crucial new alliance brings unique
    reach, knowledge and skills to help stop the impact of dangerous misinformation,”
    said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the
    \ Africa Infodemic Response Alliance  will work collaboratively to counter false
    information around COVID-19 vaccines and complement on the ground public health
    awareness raising and community engagement efforts by creating demand for vaccines
    in the region.\n\nThe network is the first initiative of its kind and it brings
    together 13 international and regional organizations and fact-checking groups
    with expertise in data and behavioural science, epidemiology, research, digital
    health, and communications to detect, disrupt and counter damaging misinformation
    on public health issues in Africa. \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure
    by data holders and support journalists and media outlets to effectively share
    lifesaving information based on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation
    on health issues. It also aims to support individual African countries in developing
    tailored infodemic management strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours,
    recruiting specialists and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in
    research and analytics.\n\nThis initiative puts into practice key recommendations
    on infodemic management that were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines
    in early 2020 under the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics
    (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation
    of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified
    initiative, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational,
    Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse.
    Participating and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse
    Fact Check, PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
    public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
    for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
    ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
    can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
    Health Lab."

  body: "Every effort to promote WhatsApp tiplines introduces the organization’s brand
    and content to new users and builds the audience. [Previous ad campaigns](https://meedan.com/blog/how-our-fact-checking-partners-promote-their-whatsapp-tiplines/)
    run by our partner fact-checking organizations have demonstrated that a strong
    community engagement strategy, branding and a focussed call for action can be
    extremely useful. \n\nWe now have new insights from the latest round of campaigns
    launched in November 2020. Here are few to consider while implementing ad campaigns
    for promoting WhatsApp tiplines:\n\n#### 1. Identify a theme tied to the news
    cycle or audience needs\nThe theme of the ad being launched can depend on the
    news cycle, misinformation trends in the region, the partner organization’s expertise
    and target audience. Be it generic or a focussed call for action, it is important
    to strike a chord with users. Some themes followed by partners in the recent campaign
    included local elections, credible information on government schemes especially
    for the poor and COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation. \n\n#### 2. Know your
    audience \nBased on the theme, target the core audience or the audience the organization
    would like to attract. The targeting can include certain cities or states, people
    with specific interests or different age groups. \n\n#### 3. Put yourself in the
    shoes of the audience\nThe ad content and images need to resonate with the target
    audience. Consider using the local language of the area and images that are local.
    Ask people to send in queries, suspicious messages or misleading information that
    they would like verified. \n\n#### 4. The campaign needs to align with organizational
    goals\nIs the objective to get queries for fact-checking or engage the audience
    and inform them about the tipline service and the organization? The organization
    needs to ask these questions and design its campaign accordingly. \n\n#### 5.
    Plan in advance whether and when to pause \nMost of our Indian fact-checking partners
    chose to pause the ad during the Diwali week, when festivities extend for a week
    and the news cycle slows down. However, some saw it best to run the ad for two
    straight weeks rather than just one. \n\n#### 6. Have the bot and team ready to
    engage with audience\nIt is important that the users have  clear instructions
    on how to submit a request or to access a bot resource. It is also important for
    organizations to have resources, both human and bot, ready, in order to respond
    to submissions and engage with users.\n\n#### 7. Monitor results and adapt\nThe
    first two days of ad campaigns can give organizations a feel of whether the tipline
    is receiving more conversations than usual. If not, it is useful to revisit the
    ad settings and make quick changes in a trial and error method. \n\n#### 8. Get
    the strategy vetted by social media and editorial teams \nInsights from both teams
    can help in designing a solid strategy. Creation of ad content, choosing the audience
    and making quick changes in ad settings and bot menu require both teams to work
    in tandem. \n\n#### 9. Develop a multichannel promotion strategy\nCross platform
    promotion is a great strategy to adopt. This helps in bringing the audience from
    all platforms to the WhatsApp tipline. Posts or tweets by the organization’s team
    members promoting the tipline can also be a big push for the ads. This can be
    helpful as the audience often identifies with the people who make the brand.\n"

  body: |-
    Since October 2019, Meedan has run a [global fact-checking project ](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)using the WhatsApp Business API and powered by [Check](https://meedan.com/check), an open-source platform built by Meedan. During the year, we entered into new and exciting partnerships with fact-checking groups and newsrooms across the globe to combat misinformation. As a community, we have made huge strides and learned from each other.

    In November 2020, we launched an interview series to present insights from individual fact-checkers and editors who are members of our partner organizations. The interviews capture our partners' experiences related to fact-checking and their vision for the future. We interviewed [Kritika Goel, Associate Editor at the Quint](https://meedan.com/blog/meet-kritika-goel-associate-editor-the-quint/) in the first part of the interview series.

    This time we have Cecília Sorgine and Maria Clara Pestre, two young fact checkers with [AFP Checamos](https://checamos.afp.com/list) who have just covered the municipal elections in Brazil. As our Phase I partner, AFP Checamos has provided us great inputs in building features for Check to suit the needs of fact-checkers. In this interview, we learn more about their journey and experience as fact-checkers in Brazil, one of the leading democracies in the world.

    ### How long have you been a fact-checker? What has been your experience before becoming one? What brought you to this?

    Maria Clara: I've been a fact-checker at AFP for almost two years. Before that, I worked at the Reuters' bureau in Rio translating and adapting international news to the Brazilian audience. A few years before that, I worked at Globo.com, writing technology articles based on SEO metrics.

    In 2018, seeing an expressive increase in online misinformation, especially regarding that year's presidential election, I started studying fact-checking and its methods. That's when I decided to research the impact of fact-checking organizations on the Brazilian 2018 elections as my final college essay. Soon after that I started fact-checking myself.

    Cecília Sorgine: I've been working as a fact-checker since February 2018. Before that I already worked at AFP for two years with international news, translating and editing texts for the Brazilian public. My professional career has been built at AFP, as I started as an intern taking care of social networks and the multimedia part of the website accessed by agency's clients.

    While at university, I became familiar with fact-checking as a niche that was beginning to develop in journalism and I became interested in it. I took a course and soon after came the opportunity to work within the agency itself as a fact-checker.

    ### What is the Brazilian media and fact-checking ecosystem like? What strengths and what gaps do you see?

    The Brazilian fact-checking ecosystem is still relatively new, as in most places, but we see a rich and diverse scenario, with clever and engaged fact-checkers. As a result, collaborative fact-check initiatives are on the rise such as the [Comprova Project](https://projetocomprova.com.br/), that brings together around 30 Brazilian media outlets, and a [special project run by Brazil's Superior Electoral Court](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/brazilian-election-fact-checkers-detected-16-electoral-hoaxes-in-48-hours-a-third-of-the-total-registered-in-2018/) to fight misinformation in elections in 2020. AFP is  part of both the initiatives.

    We would like to see more of such collaborations with political bodies, especially before the 2022 presidential election.  

    ### You just covered Brazil municipal elections - what kind of misinformation and trends did you see in this election and how did you address them?

    This year's election saw a different misinformation flow than in the past years: much more focused on the electoral process than on the candidates themselves. As a whole, the electronic ballot remained a target, with multiple posts questioning the safety of the system and the legitimacy of the official results.

    In that context, it was even more important to act quickly as a small local complaint could jeopardize the entire electoral integrity. With that in mind, we worked on almost 30 claims and are still closely monitoring the subject.

    The above-mentioned fact-checking coalition formed by the Superior Electoral Court was also a big help this year, making it easier for us to access official information and helping us increase our content's reach.

    ### What are the kind of challenges you face while fact-checking misinformation and engaging with users on social media?

    The biggest challenge of fact-checking is being able to handle the amount of misinformation circulating on social media and checking it before it causes serious damage.

    Besides that, depending on what is being verified, in a country which has been experiencing intense polarization, the audience shows resistance to fact-check articles as in many cases it challenges their core beliefs. But we still notice more willingness among users in wanting to refute false content and sending it to us so that we can verify it.

    ### How has been your experience of using Check? What else would you like the tool to do for you?

    Check has been very useful, enabling us to automatically interact with our readers, while we still have time to identify and verify misleading posts.

    Specifically, we're happy with the way we can easily adapt the bot responses to our needs. This has proven helpful during the whole coronavirus pandemic, but also for specific events such as the municipal elections. In both cases, we were able to create tailored menu options, allowing our users to filter content depending on their interest.

    To make it even better for our readers, we'd love it if they could search for specific debunks using keywords directly on WhatsApp.

    ### What is your vision and hopes for journalism and the world in a post- pandemic world?

    The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a very worrying scenario of discrediting science and verified information, with conspiracy theories and miracle cures gaining a larger number of followers.

    On the other hand, and possibly due to the large number of false allegations that have circulated since the new coronavirus was detected, the audience is trying to protect themselves from misleading content, becoming more aware and less tolerant with misinformation.

    In this context, journalists and fact-checkers have an even more important role in raising awareness about what people are publishing on the internet and flagging statements, which are deceptive, specifically from politicians and prominent figures.

  body: "In December 2020, Meedan completes one year of running a [global fact-checking
    project](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)
    using the WhatsApp Business API. Meedan worked with WhatsApp, Facebook and Facebook's
    third party fact-checking organizations (3PFCs) from India, Brazil and Africa
    to run the end-to-end fact-checking project on WhatsApp tiplines and [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
    an open-source platform built by Meedan. Our fact-checking partners include [BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in/),
    [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check), [Africa Check](https://africacheck.org/)
    and [AFP](https://factcheck.afp.com/) (Brazil and India),  [Factly](https://factly.in/),
    [Vishvas News](https://www.vishvasnews.com/), [Estadão Verifica](https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/estadao-verifica/),
    [Agência Lupa](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/10/22/lupa-canal-whatsapp/),
    and [Webqoof](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof). \n\nDuring this period,
    the fact-checking community addressed misinformation around elections, current
    news events and a pandemic which is yet to recede.The pandemic and resulting lockdowns,
    induced a greater reliance on digital technologies to remain connected. Simultaneously,
    misinformation soared and our partners' tiplines saw a surge in submissions. Amid
    this major upheaval, the gritty and relentless work of fact-checkers and our team
    is a huge accomplishment.\n\nIn this post, we discuss the highlights of the project
    and document the insights gathered through this partnership.\n\n### Highlights
    of the project \n\n#### Doubling our partnerships in one year\n\nOur collaboration
    with five global fact-checkers - [BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in/), [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check),
    [Africa Check](https://africacheck.org/) and [AFP](https://factcheck.afp.com/)
    (Brazil and India), in phase I of the project was key to further customizing Check
    to meet the needs and demands of fact-checking misinformation in closed messaging
    networks.\n\n> \"We are amazed with the progress with the tool. If you look at
    the tool from the beginning to now, you can see how much it's made customizable.
    You really want to know our needs and you try hard to do your best to make the
    tool fit with our needs\" -- Elodie Martinez, Coordinator AFP Latin America\n\nIn
    the second phase, five news partners - [Factly](https://factly.in/), [Vishvas
    News](https://www.vishvasnews.com/), [Estadão Verifica](https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/estadao-verifica/)
    - an initiative of Estadão; [Agência Lupa](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/10/22/lupa-canal-whatsapp/),
    and [Webqoof](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof) - the fact-check wing of
    The Quint joined the project.\n\n> \"In just that last two months we have already
    found that it has really been a force multiplier in being able to track down fake
    posts.\" -- Ritu Kapur, Founder and CEO, The Quint\n\nWith more collaborations
    and focussed efforts we have been able to scale up distribution of fact-checks.
    As of November 2020, all ten tiplines interacted with over 600,000 unique users
    and distributed over 15,000 fact-checks across India, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya
    and Nigeria. Within 5 months of launching the Phase I tiplines, Check had distributed
    around 5,800 fact-check reports. \n\n> \"Partnering with such diverse organizations
    and maintaining a constant stream of feedback and ideas flowing has helped us
    improve the platform tremendously, shaping it to fit the specific needs of our
    growing community of fact-checkers. As a result, our 2021 roadmap is both precise
    and ambitious, with a focus on more automation, integration and new bot features
    with the goals of scaling audiences.\" - Pierre Conti, Director of Product, Meedan\n\n####
    Check has become an integral part of partners' workflow\n\nThe progress we made
    is most evident in Check, the tool that powers this project. \"Our goal with Check,\"
    explained Meedan's Director of Product Pierre Conti, \"is to build a scalable
    human and AI system for fact-checkers to efficiently size the demand for verification
    directly from their audience, cut through the noise, and maximize impact by helping
    them to prioritize their response to the most pressing misinformation.\"\n\nWeek
    after week, hinging on a global team and constant input from our partners, Check
    matured into a robust platform for fact-checking and information crisis response.
    We redesigned interfaces and experience from the ground up, created an easy-to-deploy
    multilingual bot system to collect claims from users and publish content, and
    added new layers of  automation to content triage and algorithmically match similar
    claims, making it easier and faster for journalists to focus on emerging yet viral
    claims and respond at scale.\n\n> \"In 2020 we had an exciting set of new features
    and scalability improvements in order to accommodate the needs of different partners
    that came onboard. It's great to see how the software has evolved.  I hope we
    can keep evolving together in 2021.\" - Caio Almeida, Director of Engineering,
    Meedan\n\n### Program and product support: We provided critical health expertise
    and developed strategic guidance for each partner\n\nAt Meedan, we believe that
    ideas, people and vision give purpose to technology. As a result, we have integrated
    strong programmatic elements in our service. Some of the program elements are
    listed below:\n\n- Recognizing the need for expert advice and knowledge to address
    misinformation around a newly emerged disease - COVID-19, **Meedan's [Digital
    Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/) set up the [COVID-19 database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)**.
    Our expert panel proactively identify potential misinformation and address queries
    from fact-checkers within a 24-48 hours timespan. This has expanded to cover other
    health misinformation as well. All our partners can submit a query directly from
    the Check workspace through an integrated intercom service.\n- In November 2020
    we introduced a newsletter, **CheckPost** with the aim of sharing best practices
    & insights from the WhatsApp end-to-end fact-checking project with all our partners.\n-
    The team worked with partners to implement **[advertising campaigns](https://meedan.com/blog/how-our-fact-checking-partners-promote-their-whatsapp-tiplines/)**
    supported by Facebook in order to promote tiplines. Based on our weekly analysis
    of data and insights from all partners, we have provided regular feedback on the
    bot menu and advertisement content to each partner. This has increased conversations
    and resulted in more submissions to the tiplines.\n- Meedan's program and product
    teams **regularly test tiplines and inspect Check workspaces** to identify bugs
    and the need for new features.\n- By integrating **intercom service in the workspace**,
    partners are able to reach out to us with bug reports or any other technical difficulties
    round the clock.\n- Data is key to understanding what works, since September we
    provide **weekly data updates** to partners and discuss Key Performance Indicators
    during weekly check-ins.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers, public
    health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential for addressing
    the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational ambiguity
    based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge can exacerbate
    the spread of disease. Tiplines offering localized, relevant and up-to-date health
    information is a new frontier of health communications and health literacy, and
    fact-checkers are at the forefront.\" --Nat Gyenes, Program Director, Digital
    Health Lab, Meedan\n\n### Key insights from the project\n\n- Bots can engage WhatsApp
    users; they are the new audience engagement paradigm. Designing effective bots
    with clear and unambiguous scripts and updated menus can generate quality submissions
    for WhatsApp tiplines.  \n- Following the news cycle is important for tiplines.
    Large events have generated more misinformation and have resulted in more submissions
    for the tiplines.\n- Fact-checkers need no-nonsense, no-code interfaces in multiple
    languages.\n- With well devised plans, machines in the loop augment quality human
    efforts \n- Analysis of workspace data and agility in adopting new strategies
    are important for building WhatsApp audience and staying ahead of the curve.\n\n>
    \"Working in regions where WhatsApp is among the most popular messaging platforms,
    the tiplines are a great strategy to engage with WhatsApp users and provide credible
    and verified information. By making available information and resources in local
    languages on the tiplines, our partners have been able to provide high quality
    content to WhatsApp users. This year COVID-19 misinformation has shown us how
    important it is to follow the news cycle to address misinformation. This helps
    us prepare for 2021 and get ready to address COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation
    through the tiplines.\" - Shalini Joshi, Program Director - APAC, Meedan\n\n###
    Future plans\n\nThe fight against misinformation is a continuous process and fact-checking
    more than ever needs to stay ahead of the curve. As the world witnessed a misinfodemic,
    narratives that challenge the integrity of elections and institutions in democracies,
    there is a need to scale up the work of fact-checkers.\n\nIn the coming year we
    will: \n\n- Continue to share insights and best practices across all partners
    and build collective knowledge\n- Improve Check for greater automation for scaling
    up fact-checking and optimizing the time of fact-checkers\n- Support media literacy
    campaigns and training programmes to srengthen the skills of fact-checkers "

    en-US: Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
      support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines
  body: "Journalists and fact-checkers around the world will soon have a dedicated
    support service to help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines thanks to a global
    alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s public health
    expert team, supported by the Google News Initiative.\n\nIn 2020 Meedan’s Digital
    Health Lab developed a [COVID-19 rapid information response initiative](https://health-desk.org/)
    to support our fact-checking and community media partners around the world, as
    they worked tirelessly to respond to COVID-19 misinformation. We were able to
    launch the initiative with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the
    Omidyar Network, and the Google News Initiative. In  2021, Meedan will be expanding
    the supported range of health topics as part of [Health Desk](https://health-desk.org/),
    \ beginning with the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nOver the last year, the public health
    expert team working on Health Desk created a system for providing rapid responses
    to questions shared by fact-checkers, journalists, and other communicators around
    the world sharing vital COVID-19 information with different audiences. In response
    to health questions from fact-checkers and journalists (which you can always submit
    [here](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/ask-a-question), or via email directly to
    health@meedan.com), our team:\n\n- Reviews and summarizes the latest science for
    the topic that you are reporting on\n- Provides background and context for that
    topic as it relates to health research more generally, and\n- Gives you a list
    of important additional resources or sources you can review for your reporting
    or fact-checking\n\nBuilding off of this work, in partnership with the Australian
    Science Media Centre and their network of additional Science Media Centres around
    the world, the COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub will bring together multiple sources
    of evidence-based information on vaccines with material available in at least
    seven languages. The alliance will involve collaboration with organisations and
    experts from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
    region.\n\n“The threat of health misinformation has become a vector for the spread
    of infectious diseases and in the context of COVID-19, a  significant barrier
    to vaccine adherence. We see a networked approach to addressing information equity
    challenges as a critical public health need. With the global science community
    collaborating on providing fact-checkers and media partners with reliable, and
    time-sensitive health information that communicators can effectively report and
    respond to the vaccine information needs of their audiences. We are honored to
    work with the Australian Science Media Centre and their partner Science Media
    Centres on this critical initiative,” said Nat Gyenes, Director of the Meedan
    Digital Health Lab.\n\nThe media hub will include expert commentary and explainers
    that will help journalists and fact-checkers report on the science behind the
    COVID-19 vaccines being developed. \n\n“The COVID-19 vaccine development and roll-out
    are unprecedented. Fighting misinformation about this topic will require both
    targeting harmful hoaxes directly and supporting the crucial work of science beat
    reporters and fact-checkers informing the public. It is with this in mind that
    we’re thrilled to support the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub to help
    journalists access expertise rapidly and reliably”, said Alexios Mantzarlis, News
    and Information Credibility Lead, Google News Lab\n\n“The enormous impact of this
    pandemic has meant that scientists and pharmaceutical companies have had to go
    into overdrive to produce vaccines in record time. With so many vaccines in various
    stages of development, it can be very confusing for journalists and the public
    and this is where we hope to help,” said Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO of the AusSMC.
    “It’s now more critical than ever that we all have access to clear information
    about these vaccines as they are being developed”.\n\nIf you’re a fact-checker,
    journalist, community organizer or communicator working to respond to vaccine
    misinformation or strengthen vaccine adherence, and you’re interested in collaborating
    or learning more, please reach out to health@meedan.com, and check out our existing
    health information resources: [https://health-desk.org/](https://health-desk.org/),
    and sign up to receive updates on the launch of the [Vaccine Media Hub](https://health-desk.org/vaccines/).

  body: "### On November 20, 2020 the Check Global program organized a regional event
    for its partners from the Asia-Pacific region. The event brought together 11 organizations,
    including our long term partners and a new community of civil society organizations
    from the region who were awarded microgrants as part of Check Global’s COVID-19
    response fund. \n\n2020 has been an incredibly challenging year for civil society
    groups, newsrooms and fact-checkers. Yet, we were blown away by the energy at
    the Check Global event organised for the APAC region on November 20,2020. There
    were 16 attendees from 11 groups who shared videos, slides, data and analyses
    of how they've been able to address the Covid-19 pandemic through their work this
    year. \n\nThe groups that came together for this event included current and past
    Check Global partners from APAC, Covid-19 microgrant recipients from the region
    as well as other civil society and independent groups working from South Asia
    to East Asia. \n\nThe discussion that followed the introductions and presentations
    by each group was extremely relevant for the region. Here are learnings and highlights
    from each of the participant organizations: \n\n**Open Development Cambodia**
    - Providing the public easy access to up-to-date, reliable and fact-checked data
    is critical in order to understand the progression of the pandemic and policy
    measures adopted by the government. \n\n**Sadbhavana Trust, India**  - The COVID-19
    mobility restrictions further curtailed the movement of women and made them more
    vulnerable to gender-based violence. For an organization that works with women
    on such a sensitive issue, it was important for their digital / remote intervention
    to be as effective as their work during ‘normal’ times when face-face interactions
    were possible. \n\n**Disability Empowerment Society, Nepal**  - Rights in the
    civic space are often biased against differently abled. Advocacy for the rights
    of differently abled and their empowerment through technology became more significant
    and urgent during the pandemic. \n\n**Lalang Hu Mga Laga, Philippines** - It is
    important to connect women from local communities who are off the grid; during
    the pandemic there is a need to create a safe online environment and build trust
    and connections with community members. \n\n**BasaBali, Indonesia** - The underserved
    and minority communities of Bali were open to discuss challenges faced during
    the pandemic. Better understanding of the local language and culture is key for
    greater reach and impact. \n\n**Saraswati Foundation, Nepal**  - Conventional
    means of communication such as FM radio and content in local languages were important
    to effectively disseminate crucial health information to minority populations
    during the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n**Rappler, Philippines** - Fact-checking is
    crucial for quality online information during times such as the current pandemic
    when information is scarce and biased. Media literacy programs that raise awareness
    about fact-checking and introduce more people to verification and fact-checking
    tools are also necessary during such times. \n\n**Taiwan Fact Check Center**  -
    Media literacy programmes and collaborations with organizations that work among
    different sections of the population such as the youth, elderly and teachers are
    important in making fact-checking more effective. \n\n**VERA Files, Philippines**
    - Fact-checking and verification training often face the obstacle of poor internet
    connectivity in rural areas. Short videos and translations in different local
    languages can help in reaching a wider audience. \n\n**Tempo, Indonesia** -  Fact-checking
    organizations value both editorial independence and sustainability. While advertisements
    are often a common financial strategy, transitioning to a subscription model is
    often needed to maintain independence. \n\n**Phandeeyar, Myanmar** -  For fact-checkers,
    when multiple crises and events such as elections and pandemics occur simultaneously,
    collaboration with technology partners and adoption of technological solutions
    such as chatbots are crucial strategies. \n\nThere was a strong vote for more
    regional events in the future; given our contexts that are similar, time zones
    that are closer and issues that are common, the group present at the event advocated
    for the Check Global Network to take the lead in organising online events for
    APAC in the coming year as well. The events can ensure greater sharing of strategies
    and best practices and with more time built in for reflection and discussion,
    the events can also provide an opportunity for groups in different countries to
    express solidarity with each other during challenging times. \n\nThe role of fact-checkers
    has been extremely critical in 2020. From addressing misinformation related to
    elections in some countries to combating a pandemic - their work has been relentless
    and significant in 2020. Yet, fact-checkers have been targeted and criticised
    for their work, for not leaning towards majoritarian views and for taking on challenging
    issues. A suggestion was made to document this work of fact-checkers through a
    video reflecting the work of fact-checkers from across the APAC region. \n\nWith
    Covid-19 vaccination programs being planned or rolled out in 2021, the region
    expects to witness a fresh wave of disinformation and conspiracies on the vaccine.
    The group expressed the need for events that bring together health professionals
    and journalists with the goal of bridging the two fields of medicine and communication
    together so that we could collectively prepare well and strengthen our work towards
    health-related fact checking. \n\nCheck Global program and the Check Global Network
    are committed to taking forward these ideas in 2021.\n"

    en-US: How the Check Global COVID-19 microgrant recipients from Africa responded
      to the pandemic and ensuing misinfodemic
  body: "While Africa has had the [lowest proportion](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
    of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths globally, restrictions imposed in response
    to the pandemic have had an outsized impact on ordinary citizens, with reports
    of [more than 100 other executive measures](https://www.icnl.org/post/analysis/african-government-response-to-covid-19)
    that have heavily curbed the freedom of movement and of peaceful assembly being
    put in place in response to the pandemic.\n\nOne particularly serious challenge
    was the rise of false information around the disease, termed as an 'infodemic',
    which resulted from the lack of information and conflicting statements from authorities,
    and was made worse by bad actors taking advantage of the information vacuum to
    push their own false messages.\n\nWith this in mind, Meedan's Check Global program
    organized an event bringing together six [microgrant recipients](https://meedan.com/blog/25-grassroots-projects-awarded-through-the-check-global-covid-19-fund/)
    from Africa who had set up projects to respond to these challenges in their countries
    in various ways, such as setting up platforms to inform the public about the disease,
    connecting people with these platforms, and finding ways to tackle other related
    problems that may not have been anticipated, but were manifesting as a direct
    consequence of COVID-19.\n\nThe six grantees are:\n\n-   Individual grantee __Cecilia
    Maundu__ from  Kenya, who ran a campaign on social media to highlight incidents
    of online violence related to the pandemic\n\n-   __People's Check__ from Nigeria,
    who  fact-checked and verified viral health misinformation and disinformation
    that has affected people's health and lives,\n\n-   __Radio Daljir__, a Somali
    language radio station that ran media literacy campaigns and radio reporting in
    Puntland and Galmudug regions of Somalia to bring health facts to the public\n\n-
    \  __Family Health Foundation__, who  documented human rights violations associated
    to COVID-19 interventions in Tanzania, in collaboration with human rights defenders,
    activists and local artists,\n\n-   The __Media Challenge Initiative__ from Uganda,
    who produced and aired a series of youth-led fact checking news bulletins to debunk
    fake stories trending on social media,\n\n-   __Zéro Pauvre Afrique__, a network
    of volunteers in Guinea, who tracked and deconstructed false information around
    the COVID-19 crisis in the country and shared this information on a public portal.\n\nRepresentatives
    from these organizations, along with [Check Global partners](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
    \ [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) and [CITE](https://cite.org.zw/) from East
    and Southern Africa, took part in the event, highlighting the impact of the pandemic
    on their operations and on the countries and societies they operate in.\n\nOne
    emerging theme was that COVID-19 presented some opportunities for them to engage
    and share their work with new audiences, while at the same time the limits on
    movement and restrictions such as curfews and lockdowns made it difficult to operate
    efficiently. \n\nThe participants also acknowledged the fact that the challenges
    they faced were quite similar despite differences in language and local realities.
    These include the fact that messaging platforms and social networks played a significant
    role in the spread of false information. \n\nTwo partners, Zero Pauvre Afrique
    and the Family Welfare Foundation, also worked during elections in Guinea and
    Tanzania respectively, and they shared their experiences of handling health misinformation
    during periods of significant political activity. The main lessons that they learnt
    were on the significance of engaging with other partners and networks, and the
    need to set up support mechanisms for teams as they worked through these trying
    times. \n\nRadio Daljir in Somalia and the Media Challenge Initiative in Uganda
    both work on 'traditional' platforms, that is radio and television, so they focused
    their projects on finding innovative ways to use these platforms to engage existing
    audiences and attract new ones. One way that Radio Daljir did this was through
    radio theatre to spread credible health information, while MCI used video bulletins
    with debunks featuring experts to debunk popular claims circulating on a variety
    of platforms. \n\nSimilarly, People's Check set up a project to fact-check and
    verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that affect people's health
    and lives in Nigeria, using media and information literacy training to educate
    those who were likely to fall for false information on how to spot it and avoid
    sharing it inadvertently. \n\nCecilia Maundu, the individual grantee from Kenya,
    looked at an indirect consequence of the pandemic, which is the increase in online
    violence, particularly against women and girls, by creating a safe space for freedom
    of expression, as well as highlighting the severity of the problem and discussing
    mitigation measures. \n\nOut of this event, the microgrant recipients identified
    various areas of collaboration around COVID-19 given that the pandemic is still
    ongoing and the number of cases is still rising in the region. False information
    around the various vaccines being rolled out is likely to be a key area of concern,
    and this, as the participants pointed out, will need to be addressed quickly and
    effectively. \n\nThe conversation and knowledge-sharing event had been scheduled
    for two hours, with the partners sharing what they did and the work they undertook
    with funding from the microgrants, but had to extend by an hour given the amount
    of work the participants had actually undertaken. \n\nThis first microgrant to
    respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a significant response from
    African organizations working to respond to and curb the impacts of the COVID-19
    misinfodemic, and we are looking into other ways to support independent media
    organizations working in Africa through the Check Global program."

  body: "On November 24, we invited our COVID-19 grantees to a special conversation
    to share their projects and how challenges faced during the pandemic affected
    their wellbeing. Facilitated by Lu Ortiz, the event was a closed virtual space
    to strengthen the community of grantees by listening and sharing healing practices
    that are ancestral and decolonial. We created a collective recipe book with tea
    recipes, rituals and other learnings in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nPresent were
    members of the leading fact-checking work in Cuba an alliance of two independent
    media outlets ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and
    [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)), the fact checking organization [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/),
    the all women photography collective [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com/),
    [Coletivo Mulherias](https://www.uol.com.br/universa/colunas/mulherias/) and [Chicas
    Poderosas Ecuador](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/). Lastly, facilitator
    Lu Ortiz is part of Vita Activa, an initiative that provides online support for
    women, LGBTIQ+, journalists and activists.\n\nListening to the Check Global community,
    one thing became clear: we, as a community, needed some time to breathe and a
    space for healing. The pandemic and conditions of political, social and economic
    crisis in the Latin America region generated in people who work in the media,
    activists and human rights defenders, feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, fatigue,
    dependence, lack, loneliness and insomnia, according to Vita Activa. \n\nWhen
    envisioning this event the inspiration was the work of  artist and activist Tricia
    Hersey's, the [Nap Ministry](https://thenapministry.wordpress.com/), she believes
    rest is a form of resistance and names sleep deprivation as a racial and social
    justice issue. [Hersey](http://www.triciahersey.com/about.html)'s radical praxis
    puts the wellbeing of people of color first, and this resonates with Latam's historical
    context. During this pandemic there was no slow down in human rights events and
    publications, on the contrary, 2020 accelerated it all. Our community members
    had to face already oppressive realities now in the pandemic twist. \n\nWith this
    in mind Lu Ortiz's work with Vita Activa was an invitation to the community to
    connect and breathe. The workshop was born from the need to open virtual spaces
    where women and non-binary folks come to collectively heal their digital ailments.
    \n\nThese learnings shared here were developed in a collaborative setting between
    activist journalists and human rights defenders in Latin America, people who feel
    and live intensely their connection with the earth, with their digital bodies
    and with the world around them. It is advisable to match the remedies described
    here to the circumstances of each person, this content is not intended to be a
    substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\"><iframe

  body: "As Meedan and the Check Global program wraps up 2020, we are so excited to
    launch our zine *Viral Politics: Tales from the Pandemia*. Artists from throughout
    the Global South have illustrated the ways the pandemic has affected digital surveillance,
    freedom of speech and gender-based violence in their home countries, and how they
    resist. Check it out below!\n\nZines are independent publications sharing discourses
    of political and social resistance, historically produced by underrepresented
    communities. We invite you to play and interact with this digital object. We encourage
    you to make it your own, print pages of it, cut them, glue them, add glitter.
    Take a picture and send it to us, to your local authorities and your community.
    These are challenging times, and we believe arts activism (artivism) can be used
    as a tool for change and politically transformative therapy to survive quarantine
    and ignite meaningful conversations and interactions.\n\nWe envisioned creating
    this zine at the beginning of the pandemic, when media attention primarily focused
    on how the Global North handled the crisis and ignored the health emergencies
    of the Global South. Simultaneously, Europe and North America's call for expanded
    surveillance technology to fight the pandemic gained traction across the world,
    but this call would ultimately affect people living under autocratic political
    regimes very differently.\nAll the while, Big Tech continues to use this moment
    to increase unethical and unregulated data collection practices, dealing a blow
    to years worth of global policy and digital security advocacy. The ramifications
    of such policies in developing economies exacerbated local activists' and minority
    groups’ vulnerability and will continue to do so well after the pandemic. \n\nIn
    this context, amplifying voices of artists and organizers of the Global South
    is essential to more directly serve their communities and talk about their own
    pandemic-era issues. Together nine talented comic artists from APAC (Asia Pacific),
    NAWA (North Africa & West Asia), Africa and Latin America were able to convey
    these concerns. Most entries were written in each artists' home language and then
    translated into English.\n\nTechnology unites the themes of all 7 comic entries,
    shared below:\n\n- In Tunisia, we learn Othman Selmi's \"ABC's of COVID-19 in
    Tunisia.\"\n- In Lebanon, Maya Chams takes us into a gamified experience of tech
    militarization.\n- In Uganda, Martin Kharumwa presents the nation's social media
    tax as a barrier to people's right to access information.\n- In Brazil, comic
    artist Bennê Oliveira shares a domestic worker's daily life in the favelas using
    WhatsApp groups to self-govern in the absence of government support.\n- In Mexico,
    Mariana Lorenzo (Maremoto) showcases the rise of violence against women both online
    and offline through reworking the classic fairytale about Red Riding Hood.\n-
    In India, Vishakha Prakash's powerful collages portray state censorship of women
    activist's voices.\n- In China, Sage Cheng illustrates a tale of Chinese communities'
    resilience to state tech interference.\n\nFinally, Honduran artist Gago Ilustra
    unites these stories throughout the zine with his signature neon post-apocalyptic
    style. In 2021, we look foward to continue supporting our communities through
    artmaking as a form of resistance.\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\"><iframe

    In 2020, online misinformation was one of the most daunting obstacles in the world's battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 is already witnessing a wave of COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation. In order to find out more about the nuances and the complexities of the misinformation landscape ahead of us, we decided to turn to our fact-checking partners for their expert opinions on what we should expect in 2021. In this blogpost, we present to you some regional and global forecasts from our partners in the Asia-Pacific region.

    __1. COVID-19 misinformation will challenge each step of vaccination campaigns.__

    Trust would be the most essential factor in running successful vaccination drives in countries. As more vaccines get the final go-aheads and countries start their vaccination drives, we can expect misinformation and conspiracy theories posing challenges at every step of the campaign. 

    > "We expect COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation, but more in terms of availability, distribution, and black-market deals in India" - Bharath Guniganti, Data Analyst and Fact-checker, [Factly](https://factly.in/)

    > "Globally I think sadly we will continue to see a growing wave of conspiracy theories and misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and how they are being administered. This will likely present governments around the world with significant challenges as they attempt to launch mass vaccination schemes. Unfortunately, world leaders and their governments will probably need to work harder to gain the trust of local populations in order to reassure them that the vaccines are safe. Until a large proportion of the world has been vaccinated, I fear we face many more months of local lockdowns." - [Rachel Blundy](https://twitter.com/rachelblundy), Senior Editor, [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/)

    __2. With high-stake polls in the charts, political and election misinformation will be rampant.__

    Across the globe, mis/disinformation has become a deciding factor of outcomes of national and provincial elections. This trend can no longer be ignored. In India, fact-checkers are already preparing for a deluge of misinformation around the state elections to be held in 2021. As the stakes are high, we can also expect religion being used to flare emotions and misinform people during elections in India. 

    > "COVID-19 and vaccines (positive & negative effects) in the form of misinformation should dominate the charts along with massive elections in the state of West Bengal as the ruling party  (Bharatiya Janata Party)  is trying hard to make inroads in the state." - [Uzair Rizvi](https://twitter.com/RizviUzair), Fact-Check Journalist , [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/)

    > "We foresee misinformation ahead of elections in the states of Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, and others. Particularly in Bengal, going by the news analysis and trends, we envisage an uptick in religious misinformation which is also because of the political landscape and the power dynamics in the state. We certainly feel as the election date nears, we will see political mudslinging which might rely heavily on false narratives pertaining to the current state government's (All India Trinamool Congress) performance and political misinformation." - [Kritika Goel](https://twitter.com/kritikagoel27), Associate Editor, [The Quint](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof)

    __3. Misinformation on protests and riots will see a fundamentalist spin.__

    Sweeping policy changes and the pandemic induced economic downturns have given way to dissatisfaction and protests in different parts of the Global South. For instance, the ongoing farmers protests in India will be a talking point in all the elections that are scheduled for the year.

    > "I think new variants of COVID-19 and vaccines would continue to be a dominant issue globally, but the ongoing farmers protest and upcoming state assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu are going to be the main theme of misinformation in India." - [Akhil Ranjan](https://twitter.com/akhilr23), Fact-check Reporter, [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/)

    > "If the government rolls out the Citizenship Amendment Act or the National Register of Citizens to other states in India, we can also expect a rise in misinformation that poses a threat to religious and communal harmony." - [Balkrishna](https://twitter.com/bala3047), Editor- Fact Check, [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check)

    __4. Misinformation during calamities and sporadic events can make fact-checking more complex.__

    Fact-checkers have often reported a surge in misinformation during natural calamities, pandemic and other sporadic events. These are not often isolated and unrelated pieces of misinformation, but get entangled with other issues making fact-checking more complex. 

    > "There has been a trend about misinformation on government schemes, and this has seen an increase during COVID-19 times. We expect this to continue for 2021 in some or the other forms. There is also an increase in misinformation usually around natural calamities, and the same was seen this year during cyclone Nivar, Hyderabad floods etc. The same trend is expected for 2021 at places that could see heavy rainfall, or some kind of natural calamity."  - Bharath Guniganti, Data Analyst and Fact-checker, [Factly](https://factly.in/)

    Experiences of global fact-checkers have helped us anticipate the challenges ahead of us. But they have often reminded us that we need to factor in unforeseen challenges that may come our way. While we dread those days, it is the preparedness and persistence of the fact-checking community that offers us hope.

    a network that consists of several news channels. [The India Today Fact Check](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check)
    section is managed independently from the editorial operations of the India Today
    Group. \n\nBalkrishna leads the Fact Check team at the India Today Group. Bala,
    as he is popularly called, tells us about India Today Fact Check’s vision, impact
    and challenges in this interview. \n\n__1. When did India Today start its fact-checking
    section and what was the reason for setting up a separate fact-check section?__\n\nThe
    purpose of creating a separate fact-check department was two-fold. First, to create
    awareness among the entire editorial staff of the group about the serious problem
    of misinformation and fake news being dished out, mostly through social media.
    In some media verticals such as television channels, journalists have to work
    under tremendous pressure of cutthroat competition, deadlines and breaking news.
    The idea was to sensitize them about the menace of fake news so that the number
    of mistakes could be reduced.\n\nThe second motive was to capitalize on the huge
    reach of our brands, India Today and Aaj Tak, two of India’s most popular news
    channels, and fight misinformation circulating on social media. We wanted to live
    up to the expectations of our readers and viewers who not only want credible information
    from us, but also expect us to warn them about hoaxes and fake news that they
    could possibly believe.\n\n__2. How does the work of the fact-check team impact
    or influence India Today’s larger work as a media group?__\n\nIndia Today Fact
    Check is mostly insulated from the overall editorial operations of the Group and
    works independently on a day to day basis. It directly reports to the vice-chairperson
    of the India Today Group. However, we help in verification of viral content if
    there is any specific request from any editorial team that is part of the Group.
    We also conduct in-house trainings on fact-checking.\n\n__3. As someone who has
    witnessed large- scale misinformation storms, which storm was the most turbulent
    and why (ref: election, terror attacks, pandemic, protests).__\n\nMisinformation
    related to the COVID-19 pandemic was the most challenging. The reason being, COVID-19
    misinformation directly affects the lives of every individual. It was a matter
    of life and death in a true sense. Things became even more tricky when misinformation
    related to the pandemic took a communal colour in India and minority communities
    were being targeted for the spread of the virus.\n\n__4. 2020 has been a challenging
    year for fact-checkers. What was the most challenging fact-check for you and which
    one was the most effective?__\n\nWe did a story on the most talked about and bizarre
    fact checks of 2020. [Fake, lies & photoshop: Curious cures, horny sheep and other
    stories you tripped upon](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/fake-lies-photoshop-curious-cures-horny-sheep-other-stories-you-tripped-upon-fake-news-1754861-2020-12-31).
    If we have to pick up just one, we would choose the story about the mistaken identity
    of the Hathras rape victim. This was an incident that took place in September
    2020 when a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped in Hathras district, Uttar
    Pradesh, India, allegedly by four upper caste men. After fighting for her life
    for two weeks, the girl died in a Delhi hospital. The story we worked on was challenging
    as well as impactful because even senior ministers were paying tribute to the
    wrong girl while the entire country was engrossed in the tragic case.\n\n__5.
    In what ways has Check supported your fact-checking work? In 2021, what else would
    you like Check to do for you?__\n\nChecking misinformation in closed messaging
    groups is the biggest challenge the world over and India is no exception. In India,
    almost everyone uses WhatsApp. Check is our window into the world of closed groups
    of WhatsApp without invading people's privacy. It not only helps us in tracking
    misinformation but also gives us an opportunity to build a direct rapport and
    trust with our readers and viewers. Automation within the tool makes it possible
    to deal with volume which is difficult if we fact-check messages on WhatsApp manually.
    The best part is that Check is getting better by the day and has evolved by taking
    into account our feedback. The bot resources have also helped us to get quality
    content for fact-checks while filtering out the spam. In 2021, we would like the
    tool to bring in some more features to make it faster and more powerful.\n\n__6.
    What are your plans for expansion to other languages and areas outside urban centres?__\n\nWe
    plan to scale up our fact check in Bangla language in the light of elections in
    West Bengal and also expand into some regional languages in southern India. \n"

  body: "Last week, the world woke up to news that the @realdonaldtrump account, US
    President Donald Trump's account on Twitter [had been permanently suspended](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html).
    As they wrote, \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump
    account and the context around them --- specifically how they are being received
    and interpreted on and off Twitter --- we have permanently suspended the account
    due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nTwitter's rationale for
    this cited their [Glorification of Violence policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/glorification-of-violence),
    and they cited specific Tweets as evidence within the larger context of actions
    at the U.S. Capitol. Their ultimate concerns --- incitement of violence --- parallels
    that of recent charges of [incitement of insurrection](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/12/first-thing-democrats-begin-historic-impeachment-proceedings)
    from the U.S. House of Representatives in their impeachment proceedings.\n\nOne
    important thing to recognize is that the specific questions raised with this event
    are not new, but rather newly contextualized. At Meedan, we've been engaging in
    many of the issues raised here for years now, looking at the role of platform
    responsibility, content moderation, hate speech and data standards. Our Check
    Global team in particular has been looking at these challenges from a global perspective,
    examining the role of the internet in places as far afield as Myanmar, Syria and
    Kenya.\n\nIn 2018, [Meedan established the Content Moderation Project](https://meedan.com/reports/content-moderation-toolkit/),
    an effort to led by team member Kat Lo to develop clear pathways to responsible
    content moderation for technology platforms in collaboration with stakeholders
    in academia, policy, and civil society groups. We believe that applied research
    with civil society organizations and human rights responders help us better understand
    varying experiences with content moderation and allow us to identify points of
    intervention.\n\nContent moderation is a process, not a solution in and of itself.
    In both the case of Twitter and the US House of Representatives, we've seen actions
    taken against Mr. Trump that lean on existing policies --- Glorification of Violence
    policy for Twitter, and constitutional amendments 14 and 25 for the House ---
    but that still require considerable interpretation and contextualization.\n\nWith
    the increasing complexity of content on the internet and norms around governance,
    we at Meedan believe that new standards are needed to help bridge the gap between
    industry and those seeking to engage with industry. At the moment, content moderation
    decisions appear fluid, inconsistent and confusing to the public, and they rarely
    have the same public, deliberative debate that Congressional proceedings contain.\n\nTwitter
    has comprehensively articulated their [public interest framework](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest),
    as they and many platforms have articulated their community standards. Twitter
    published a blog post providing a comprehensive analysis of their policy enforcement
    approach behind the takedown of Donald Trump's Twitter account, providing an example
    of transparency into the application of this framework that has yet to be applied
    to content moderation enforcement beyond this case. How do you build a case that
    the violations are enough to overcome exceptions afforded to public figures by
    the public interest framework?  What social media companies lack is transparency
    into the application and rationale of these standards. \n\nWhat this looks like
    globally represents further challenges. In several regions across the world, civil
    society groups have been involved in monitoring online content, and we think there
    are opportunities for this to grow through more formal partnerships. In the Asia
    Pacific region, for example, groups have flagged the links between online content
    and issues on the ground. Online misinformation and hateful content thrive on
    social and political differences that exist in the region. We've seen examples
    of these in India and Myanmar in the last three to four years when misleading,
    dangerous and hateful content was circulating on social media platforms and incidents
    of violence and mob lynchings have taken place based on some of the online content.\n\nWe've
    invited some of Meedan's team of thought leaders to contribute their thinking:\n\n>
    We can learn from Myanmar and India, where civil society groups have been advocating
    for an internet that offers freedom, privacy and inclusivity. – Shalini Joshi,
    Program Director, APAC\n\nIn India, [WhatsApp has been used](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/)
    to incite offline violence in the country. Civil society groups have been advocating
    for an internet that offers freedom, privacy and inclusivity. In contexts where
    governments are cracking down on dissent and silencing critical voices, civil
    society groups are tracking bad actors and trends that point towards the weaponization
    of platforms. Groups are holding tech companies and governments accountable through
    their investigative reporting, legal work and constant lobbying with governments
    and tech platforms. In contexts where disinformation is impacting public opinion,
    civil society groups are seeking to build an internet that is responsible and
    transparent.\n\nActivists, fact-checkers and other members of civil society have
    been tracking these incidents and have alerted governments and platforms about
    these. Yet platforms have not wanted to take action against the offenders due
    [to a fear of losing out business in expanding markets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346).
    The news of Trump's deplatforming and the incidents leading to it brought home
    the message that even in the U.S. there are real links between violence and hatred
    on the ground and hateful and dangerous content online. There have been examples
    of heads of nations in [the Philippines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/rodrigo-duterte-facebook-philippines.html)
    and [India](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346)
    using social media platforms against activists, journalists and members of civil
    society groups.\n\nDeplatforming might work to the extent that it breaks networks
    of social media users connected to persons or organisations that are actively
    spreading disinformation. This cannot be the only solution to the problem. Social
    media users spreading disinformation can reemerge with new accounts, move to other
    platforms and quickly gain followers/ supporters. Many of them are influencers
    on the ground, and for them to gain a large following on social media has been
    easy. \n\nHow do platforms then respond to the issue? Consistent, transparent
    and prompt measures on the part of platforms are necessary to address hateful
    content from becoming viral. Content moderation policies that are contextual need
    to be in place and actively used. Civil society continues to play an active watchdog
    role in several countries. Their role in monitoring online content and flagging
    issues needs to be recognised and acknowledged.\n\nAn example of civil society
    monitoring online content is that of [Myanmar Tech Accountability Network (MTAN)](https://www.mmtan.org/),
    a network of Myanmar civil society organizations coordinating efforts to mitigate
    the risk of social media induced violence, political instability and democratic
    downturn in the lead up to the Myanmar elections that were held on November 8,
    2020. Using [Meedan's Check](https://meedan.com/check), MTAN was involved in monitoring,
    archiving, annotating and responding to content that is potentially dangerous
    or false from Facebook. In the past, Facebook was allegedly used to incite hate
    and violence against the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar. Monitoring Facebook
    as well as other platforms for hateful and dangerous content in the run up to
    the elections was therefore an important strategy to mitigate risks of violence.\n\n>
    We can bridge the gap between social media platforms and civil society actors.
    – Azza el Masri, Program Associate, NAWA\n\nMore often than not, we and our partners
    at Meedan have witnessed the mass suspension of activists' accounts on Facebook,
    Twitter and Instagram in [Tunisia](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/04/facebook-deactivates-accounts-of-tunisian-political-bloggers-and-activists),
    [Egypt](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egyptian-activists-sound-alarm-over-twitter-account-suspensions),
    and[ Uganda](https://qz.com/africa/1922372/facebook-hurt-nigerias-endsars-protest-while-twitter-boosted-it/)
    and the erroneous [takedown of Syrian content](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/opinion/syria-youtube-content-moderation.html)
    on YouTube, all while misinformation in our languages festers online. These decisions,
    oftentimes linked to platforms' reliance on machine learning to sift through non-English
    content, have had unspeakable consequences on the safety of journalists, activists
    and marginalized communities while fortifying government-sponsored harmful and
    misleading content, and therefore holding up the power state actors have on public
    opinion and speech.\n\nThrough our work in [Check Global](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/),
    we have a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between independent newsrooms,
    fact-checking organizations, human rights organizations and social media platforms.
    Our partners, located in Latin America, Africa, North Africa/Western Asia (NAWA),
    and Asia-Pacific, have painstakingly worked on preserving and verifying open-source
    content of human rights violations in [Syria, Yemen,](https://mnemonic.org/) and
    [Western Sahara](https://lab.witness.org/projects/citizen-video-in-western-sahara/);
    [tracking campaign promises by election candidates, institutions, and government
    officials in Kenya](https://promisetracker.dev.codeforafrica.org/); monitoring
    content during election cycles in Myanmar and Ghana; and holding governments accountable
    through hard-hitting investigative open-source journalism in the Philippines and
    India. This means that our partners are routinely monitoring content on social
    media platforms across a plethora of languages and witness how content moderation
    policies are haphazardly applied, oftentimes to the detriment of their work and
    the work of human rights defenders across the Global South.\n\nPlatforms should
    actively engage with and involve local experts in their content moderation policies.
    Context and language proficiency will save lives. Because we know this, we see
    Check Global as the space to mediate this relationship.\n\n> Deplatforming harmful
    actors is not the only solution. Defunding also holds opportunities. – Isabella
    Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America\n\nDr. [Adilson Moreira](https://drclas.harvard.edu/news/interview-hls-alum-adilson-jos%C3%A9-moreira),
    a Harvard lawyer and professor, decided to [lead](https://www.cartacapital.com.br/justica/adilson-moreira-twitter-explora-economicamente-racismo-e-misoginia/)
    a civil lawsuit against Twitter in the Federal Public Ministry in Brazil for collective
    moral damage to Black women, as well as advocating for the implementation of rules
    and conduct aimed at combating discrimination. The representation featured several
    Black movements from urban and rural areas. According to Moreira, \"They profit
    from the strategic use that groups of people make of the spread of hatred against
    black women, which is also true of other societal segments\".\n\nMoreira focuses
    on the core of the problem: the platform's profit model. Worldwide, there's been
    a [selective silence ](https://boz.substack.com/p/who-will-be-the-first-latin-american)
    over [persistent](https://www.dw.com/en/twitter-image-cropping-racist-algorithm/a-55085160)
    racism and misinformation on platforms. Defunding the actors and filing lawsuits
    against the platforms has been the strategy for Brazillian activists and civil
    society in 2020.\n\nThe machine that keeps misinformation profitable and funded
    was hit in 2020 by the creation of [Sleeping Giants Brazil](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants_pt),
    an organization using only Twitter as a platform that worked to defund Bolsonaro's
    most vocal media supporters such as [Olavo de Carvalho, ](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/brasil/2021/01/4899699-olavo-de-carvalho-tem-conta-suspensa-no-pagseguro.html).
    De Carvalho had his online support account suspend based on the petition signed
    by some 570,000 Brazilians, and Jornal da Cidade, a conservative newspaper lost
    [$70,000 USD in advertisements. ](https://olhardigital.com.br/en/2020/12/17/noticias/criadores-da-conta-sleeping-giants-brasil-revelam-suas-identidades/).
    Sleeping Giants's strategy, [similar to its US counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giants),
    is calling out companies publicly via Twitter and connecting them to funding misinformation.
    At least 150 companies have pulled out resources from the websites and channels
    that Sleeping Giants Brazil has flagged. \n\nWe need to consider not only deplatforming,
    but defunding and de-monetizing harmful actors and make the platforms accountable
    for the space they hold for hate speech and misinformation online. This can be
    an effective complementary strategy that can accelerate the change needed for
    a safer and more equitable internet, and civil society can play a role.\n\n> We
    need to conduct robust research on the impact of content moderation decisions
    as they apply to government leaders. – Scott Hale, Director of Research\n\nIn
    general, social media platforms have 'switching costs'. They are network technologies
    just like the original telephone. Unless people you want to call also have a telephone,
    it is somewhat worthless to you. As more people get telephones. your telephone
    becomes more valuable as you can now communicate with more people (economists
    refer to this as a ['positive externality'](https://www.economicshelp.org/micro-economic-essays/marketfailure/positive-externality/)).\n\nRemoving
    a user from a dominant platform (so-called deplatforming) could be impactful because
    many users of that platform will not switch to another platform. The situation,
    of course, could be different for users whose sole or main reason to be on a platform
    was to connect with the user who has now been removed or in cases where a whole
    community is removed. Users with strong political, ideological, or other viewpoints
    may feel strongly enough to move to a new platform. Ultimately, we need more research
    on the effects of deplatforming and how these effects vary with the number of
    followers of the user deplatformed.\n\nIn general, we don't know the effects of
    deplatforming someone like Trump, and we cannot study the counterfactual (what
    would have happened had he been banned earlier or not at all?).  No doubt this
    will be a subject of future research---researchers will be able to check how many
    of Trump's followers decreased activity on Twitter following this event and/or
    stopped using Twitter all together. Those numbers, however, need to have some
    comparison or control group since users may stop using Twitter or reduce their
    activity for a wide variety of reasons. It could be simply by chance that some
    users reduced their activity at the same time Trump was banned. The timing near
    the end of his term also presents a challenge, as we might expect people to engage
    less with a lame-duck or ex-president's tweets than at the start of presidential
    term.\n\nFrom what we know of other deplatforming experiences, they seem to broadly
    work as intended. [Rogers (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0267323120922066)
    found no large migrations to Telegram after the deplatforming of certain internet
    celebrities. Writing in the New York Times, [Jack Nicas reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/alex-jones-infowars-bans-traffic.html)
    visits to InfoWars declined after the initial media publicity waned following
    the [removal of the site's owner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html)
    and content from YouTube and Facebook. Examining the 2015 ban of some subreddits,
    [Chandrasekharan et al. (2017)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3134666) found
    users who stayed reduced their use of hate speech although more users than expected
    discontinued use of the site. \n\nNone of these, however, is equivalent to the
    removal of an incumbent president. It will be import for researchers to study
    this incident and understand the extent to which users might migrate to less-visible
    platforms. It might be that this event also drives policy changes in how content
    moderation is performed."

  body: "To our incredible community of journalists, fact-checkers, podcasters, artists,
    and designers, and to the supporters that believed in the importance of collaborative
    responses to public health information inequities,\n\nThank you for making it
    possible to continue our public health response work. \n\nSince 2018, the priority
    at Meedan's Health Desk has been to alleviate the information bottlenecks between
    critical emerging scientific research and the journalism and fact-checking communities
    that need to get the information accurately and quickly. \n\nAs part of Meedan's
    Digital Health Lab, we are entering the second year of Health Desk project. Journalists
    and public health experts are continuing to work together in a time of crisis
    to get fast, reliable information to newsrooms and fact-checking organizations
    around the world. With a rapid-response publishing process that borrows from two
    distinct industries—computer engineering and television news—our all-women team
    has written more than 200 explainers on COVID-19 topics for journalists and fact-checkers.
    \n\nIn local newsrooms from Delhi to Indianapolis, our work means that journalists
    do not have to scramble to find experts for comment every time COVID-19 news breaks.
    This alleviates an information bottleneck between critical emerging scientific
    research and public audiences that need to get the information accurately and
    quickly. \n\nOver the last year, we have developed scientific collaborations with
    communicators reaching millions around the world, and now with our brilliant collaborators
    at the Australian Science Media Centre, we also have a dedicated support service
    to specifically help with reporting on COVID-19 vaccines. The includes a global
    alliance of Science Media Centres and Meedan Digital Health Lab’s in-house team
    of public health scientists and pandemic response experts, supported by the Google
    News Initiative. For updates, check out https://health-desk.org/vaccines/. \n\nWorking
    with you all over the last year has been an honor. The explainers, glossary terms
    and resources that our scientists have created to support communicators reaches
    audiences in more than 18 countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
    and North America. A sample content impact audit recently highlighted that 81%
    of the public health pieces that we have supported are on the front-page of Google
    search results for that topic in the region covered. That is such an essential
    metric as we think about the health information data voids that exist online,
    and how your work fills the information gaps that might otherwise largely contain
    problematic health misinformation.  \n\nWith a small team of scientists, researchers
    and communicators to influence diverse information spaces, these collaborations
    have shown the level of scale that can be made possible through syndication models
    for content dissemination, and strong collaborations across the public health
    and journalism fields. \n\nConversations with partner organizations have demonstrated
    how having access to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers
    can cover, and therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’and
    journalists' audiences. How can we work together to continue to fill public health
    information gaps across a variety of topics, ranging from vaccinations to infectious
    disease, from nutrition to reproductive health care? \n\nAt a presentation our
    team participated in about health misinformation hosted by the National Academies
    of Science, Engineering and Medicine, health fact-checking was identified as “the
    next frontier of health literacy”, and this is in direct response to the public
    health efforts of innovative communicators around the world. This includes our
    amazing partners: VERA Files, India Today, Nigeria Health Watch, Speak Up Africa,
    Boom Live, Africa Check, Animal Politico, and many more. We're grateful for your
    dedication to untangling complex questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, fact-checking
    in an era of evolving science and moments of uncertainty. Your response to the
    misinfodemic is vital.  \n\nWe have also started to serve local community media
    outlets in the United States, including public broadcasters such as the Atlanta
    NPR-affiliate, WABE, and Indianapolis’ public radio station WFYI, as well as large
    media organizations like the New York Times and Reuters. Through a broader network
    of public broadcasters in the United States, called America Amplified, COVID-19
    questions answered by Meedan scientists are brought to local audiences across
    the country. Our media partnerships also include Tayo Help Desk, a resource that
    offers American Filipinos localized insights into COVID-19 information. \n\nWe
    thank each and every one of the journalists, fact-checkers, and communicators
    that have come to us for support, and are looking forward to continuing collaborations
    in 2021. \n\nHere's where you can find more information about the Vaccine Media

  title: Year End Note 2020
  slug: year-end-note-2020
  body: "First, sending out huge end-of-year love to many many millions who have suffered
    loss during this terrible and surreal pandemic. I want to share a special version
    of this for my amazing colleagues here at Meedan, who have been resilient and
    heroic in so many ways. It feels a bit indulgent to muse theoretical in these
    times, but as we are forwarding a strategy for the year ahead it feels important
    to chart some of the theory that grounds our planning across a global set of programs
    and products. \n\nThe past fours years have seen the conversation on the future
    of journalism move from the existential threat of evaporating revenues and failing
    business models to an even deeper threat, the viability of the fundamental journalistic
    act of meaningfully asserting a truth in an attention distorted, truth-inverted,
    peer-to-peer distributed, fully encrypted setting.\n\nWith this we have seen our
    work on content and source verification and fact-checking become central to emerging
    digital journalism practices. There has been understandable attention to efforts
    that seek to better parse and respond to disinformation, as a practice with projects
    such as Verificado, CrossCheck, and Checkpoint, and at an infrastructure level
    with efforts such as Global Disinformation Index, Journalism Trust Initiative,
    and Credibility Coalition. For all the successes that we have seen in individual
    projects, there is a sense that the inexorable rise of encrypted messaging networks
    and the continuing erosion of the human attention span demands that we re-think
    journalism at an infrastructural level. \n\nBefore describing what this might
    look like, a bit of context on the programs and practice that has contributed
    to this thinking. \n\nAt Meedan we began our work building verification software
    as a response to our experience curating and translating content from social sources
    during Arab Spring, when much of our team was then based in the Arab Region. In
    2011, seven years before misinformation became the word of the year, our experience
    in Egypt showed both the importance of decentralized publishing and user-generated
    content and, too, the absence of methodologies, tools, and internet infrastructure
    for assessing and contextualizing this content. At the same time other orgs and
    companies, most notably Mark Little, Ainé Kerr, and the team at Storyful, began
    to put serious product energy behind this insight. Over the past nine years our
    cozy and geeky area of concern has morph into the juggernaut of the global, multi-sector,
    mis/disinformation industrial complex. We did not imagine that the tools, practice
    and theory of verifying, fact-checking, and annotating user generated media and
    claims would come to define much of the work of global civil society and would
    stand as one of the central challenges to the viability of the internet and with
    it, the promises of democracy, social justice, health justice, climate justice
    and, essentially, all the challenges of humankind which are impacted by equitable
    (accessible, available, localized, read/writeable, contextual, verifiable) information.
    \ \n\nMake no mistake, the way the current incarnation of our digital communications
    and publishing environments have impacted the ways that our society uses language
    and constructs meaning is threatening every aspect of humanity - from governance,
    to climate, to human rights, to personal health. We are right to regard the failures
    of our information ecosystem as a big deal and we are right to attempt to frame
    responses that are structural. \n\nIn It feels to us as though we are again seeing
    from our experiences monitoring and responding into closed messaging networks,
    the beginning of a new type of journalistic practice. \n\nHere is the rough arc
    that brings us to this point: \n\n2011 Begin of our development of the open source
    Check platform to enable individuals, teams, and networks of partners to transparently
    collaborate to add context to digital artifacts. \n\n2014 Work to formalize the
    processes and workflows that we bring to the trainings and delivery of event based
    initiatives. Expressed in our Pop-Up Newsroom initiative (with Dig Deeper Media),
    and deployed in Electionland, Verificado, CrossCheck, Checkpoint, and many other
    election monitoring efforts. \n\n2016 Recognition that we need to consistently
    structure and make these annotations machine readable (structured data) by creating
    standards around the efforts- called for in a post 2016 Electionland blog post.
    Expressed in our Credibility Coalition initiative (with Hacks/Hackers). \n\n2018
    Our Verificado project (with Animal Politico and AJ+ Espanol) places closed network
    monitoring, 1:1 response, and memetic/visual expression of journalistic outputs
    into the most awarded collaborative journalism effort of the year. \n\n2019 We
    took learnings from the Verificado project into the Indian election monitoring
    project Checkpoint led by Proto and involving dozens of media partners across
    India. For this project we received support from WhatsApp to code Check integration
    with the WhatsApp business API. \n\n2019-20 We launched the first formal fact-checking
    program on WhatsApp with an initial network of 6 IFCN (International Fact-Checking
    Network) partners across India, Africa, and Brazil, expanding this pilot to 11
    partners working around the world to model ‘tipline’ driven fact-checking on WhatsApp.\n\n2020
    Our Digital Health Lab was founded in 2018 to research the potential to address
    misinformation in the context of a pandemic, coining the term ‘misinfodemic.’
    Our hypothetical work turned pragmatic at the onset of COVID-19 and [launched
    a project connecting epidemiologists and public health experts](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
    with fact-checking orgs and media partners. \n\nWith all of these projects we
    have designed and built interventions that have helped to move forward the larger
    project of positively impacting the world through collaborative journalism and
    digital activism. I think there is at least as much causality as coincidence that
    has Meedan continually intersecting with the future. \n\nSo, let me try to describe
    an idea that feels as significant as the idea hatched in 2011, when we began building
    Check.  \n\nPerhaps the brick and mortar, and printed page, and the advertising
    and subscription supported web-based model of journalism all share the fundamental
    quality of being monolithic, one to many. The successful models of this stage
    in the history of human commercial endeavor, gig capitalism, are fundamentally
    just-in-time, just-in-place, just-in-context, demand-driven, and efficient. \n\nIt
    may be that we have to look in the mirror and admit that the practice of passively
    consuming news may itself be dated, and that modes and methods of journalistic
    practice that views the fundamental product of journalism as the article, or the
    listicle, or the page-served GIF is not productive, regardless how many clicks
    you might receive through a cleverly baiting or hyperbolically misleading headline.
    Maybe the future of journalism is information services, insights or assessments
    or fact-checked statements or way-finding or disinformation correcting artifacts
    that can be accessed and shared, forwarded, translated, re-contextualized, and
    improved through 1:1, just-in-time, on demand journalism that can be requested
    and delivered via closed messaging networks. And, just like Google has amassed
    great power simply by knowing where people are looking for answers, the effective
    media companies and independent journalists of the world are going to recognize
    that their role as a provider of information will, in this new era, place them
    as the recipient of questions, insights, rumors, and tips that are the real coin
    of the realm in the attention/search-driven information economy.  \n\nIt must
    be said that there are many remarkably great and brilliant people that have been
    singing the value of reader-driven news agendas for years. Jennifer Brandel is
    my favorite, this post would be infinitely less valuable if I did not say you
    should read everything she writes.\n\nA future that has media companies or journalists
    themselves owning their full content and data cycle from user’s queries and questions
    to structured data outputs from their journalism - whether that is a fact-check
    or a movie review - is perhaps a more optimistic, and more empowering twist on
    the future of journalism than we have come across recently. These user queries
    and indexes of historical content along with the AIs/tools for structuring, clustering,
    matching these to incoming/new queries and content might point the way to a journalism
    that does more to serve our information needs than our attention cravings. And
    in these imperiled times, we can use all the help we can get with our ambient
    and proximate information way-finding. \n\nWe are on the cusp of new information
    access and distribution infrastructures that will make Buzzfeed Listacles as incomprehensible
    to our grandchildren as a fax machine is to our children, and working on this
    might get us past both forms of journalistic dread - the business model and the
    disinformation - if, that is, we can accept the future that is on its way and
    have the resolve to create it in a form that is more hospitable credibility and
    authenticity and less so to those who seek to do harm to people, ideas, and societies.\n\nWe
    think this calls for new infrastructure that helps journalists to serve as context
    brokers for us as we attempt to navigate into a future where Aunt Mandy is the
    journalist and publisher.  For the past few hundred years we have had the luxury
    of enabling publishers to proxy credibility and to provide the context needed
    to make sense of the news, the internet has proven incredibly adept at scaling
    up content and incredibly poor at carrying context.  We at Meedan are committed
    to working with our partners across the range of global fact-checking organizations,
    media companies, public health journalists, investigative reporters, election
    monitors, content moderation advocates, and human rights activists to increment
    our way toward building out products and programs that model the potential for
    structured data, structured context, and human-in-the-loop AIs to improve our
    world. We are hoping the year ahead is foremost one of healing - from the pandemic
    and failings of our media and information ecosystems alike. \n\nWishing you all
    more health, peace, and _context_ in the year ahead. \n\nDec 18 2020 EAB"

  body: "__The military coup and civilian response:__ On February 1, the military
    in Myanmar took over the country, declaring a year-long state of emergency. [It
    seized control following the general election that was held on November 8, 2020](https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/analysis-myanmar-military-arrests-civilian-government-democracy).
    Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, National League for Democracy (NLD), won by a landslide
    in the election. Parliament was scheduled this week to hold its first session
    since the general election. The new Parliament was expected to endorse the election
    results and approve the next government. The military refused to accept the results
    of the vote. They tried to argue in the country’s Supreme Court that the election
    results were fraudulent and threatened to take action. [Hours before the new Parliament
    was to convene, the military detained Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and
    other top NLD leaders and took power in their hands.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55902070)
    Myanmar, which had started a fragile transition to democracy ten years ago after
    decades of brutal military dictatorship, went back in the hands of the military.
    \n\nReports of [protests and civilian disobedience](https://www.facebook.com/civildisobediencemovement2021/)
    have started emerging from Myanmar after the February 1 coup. [Staff from dozens
    of state hospitals and medical institutes have pledged to stop working in protest
    against yesterday’s coup](https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/after-coup-medical-workers-spearhead-civil-disobedience-campaign/),
    in what could prove the first major test for the new military regime. In the capital
    city of Yangon, [citizens protests by beating pots and pans and honking against
    the coup](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/yangon-residents-bang-pots-and-pans-honk-car-horns-to-protest-myanmar-military-coup-100425285722).
    Migrant workers and residents from Myanmar in Thailand and Japan have also protested
    the coup. Globally world leaders and heads of states have expressed deep concern
    over the military coup. Citizens are also registering their protest by changing
    their social media profile pictures to red (the colour associated with NLD, and
    Aung San Suu Kyi’s photos. The NLD has called for immediate release of Suu Kyi
    and other leaders of the party. Activists have urged citizens to [download and
    use secure communication platforms as a solution to internet shutdowns and potential
    state crackdown. \n](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/offline-message-app-bridgefy-downloaded-over-million-times-after-myanmar-coup)\n\n__A
    setback to democracy:__ The military coup in Myanmar is a setback to Myanmar’s
    decade-old experiment with democracy. The coup is likely to affect the transition
    of Myanmar to a democratic federal union and efforts to strengthen ethnic unity
    in conflict areas, and establish peace and development. The work of civil society
    groups and independent press in building Myanmar as a democracy over the last
    few years has also suffered a setback with the military seizing power. \n\nThe
    internet has played an important role in both repression and reform. In Myanmar,
    we see the twin challenges of limited and restricted access on the one hand and
    flooding of disinformation, misinformation and hate speech on the other. [Social
    media platforms are being flooded with rumours and misleading information](https://www.myanmore.com/2021/02/state-of-emergency-day-2-what-we-learnt-so-far/);
    parts of Myanmar also experienced an [internet shutdown and bandwidth throttling
    that has now been restored to some extent](https://www.accessnow.org/myanmar-internet-shutdown-military-coup/).
    We’ve learned that this situation has caused chaos and confusion with people not
    being able to access news, reliable information and communicate safely with each
    other. \n\n__Supporting civil society:__ Meedan is committed to supporting and
    strengthening the work of its partners and other civil society groups engaged
    in building peace and democracy in Myanmar. In 2020, with support from Reset Tech,
    we worked to strengthen the efforts of Myanmar Tech Accountability Network (MTAN),
    a network of Myanmar civil society organizations coordinating efforts to mitigate
    the risk of social media induced violence, political instability and democratic
    downturn in the lead up to the Myanmar 2020 elections. Meedan’s platform Check
    supported the transition of a manual process of content curation and annotation
    to a more collaborative and automated workflow using new features of Meedan’s
    platform, Check.\n\n__Documenting, annotating, archiving information:__ At a time
    when monitoring online content for rumours, hateful and dangerous speech is critical,
    our platform Check is available to groups working on documenting the state of
    emergency,annotating and archiving content before it can be potentially removed
    or taken down and fact-checking and/or verifying online content. \n\n__Supporting
    fact-checking:__ As a technology non-profit that has supported fact-checkers monitoring
    and responding to suspicious messages on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook,
    Meedan has supported tiplines on these platforms. We can build and launch similar
    tiplines for groups in Myanmar that are tracking and debunking false claims and
    messages. \n\n__Digital security training:__ The importance of digital security
    protocols for civil society groups and citizens cannot be underestimated at this
    point. Along with our partners we have designed and conducted online courses on
    digital security for journalists, fact-checkers and students. These courses and
    modules can be adapted for groups in Myanmar.  \n\n__Content moderation:__ Our
    [toolkit on content moderation](https://meedan.com/reports/content-moderation-toolkit/)
    is an effort to build clear pathways for technology platforms in collaboration
    with civil society groups and stakeholders in academia and policy. The toolkit
    is available for use and discussion by stakeholders in Myanmar."

    en-US: MEEDAN announced today that they will join the [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/)
      initiative, to address the threats to public discourse that AI brings as a stakeholder
      in the information integrity community.
  body: |-
    Meedan announced today that they will join the [Partnership on AI's](https://www.partnershiponai.org/) AI and Media Integrity Program to address the threats and opportunities to public discourse that AI brings.

    International news conversations are increasingly focused on misinformation found in platforms, encrypted messaging, and all digital spaces. Meedan’s role in the Partnership on AI is to offer subject matter expertise on global engagement with the fact-checking community. Meedan joins peer organizations such as [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/ "Full Fact"), [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/ "Adobe"), [Code for Africa](https://medium.com/code-for-africa "Code for Africa"), and the [Duke Reporters’ Lab](https://reporterslab.org/ "Duke Reporters' Lab") in this new venture with the Partnership on AI.

    Dr Scott A. Hale, Meedan’s Director of Research, said, “Tackling misinformation and other harmful content at scale requires a thoughtful combination of human and machine intelligence, social and computational science, and industry and academic expertise. We are excited to help bridge these divides and work with the Partnership to understand how approaches, data, and knowledge can be shared securely and ethically.”

    “Adobe, Duke Reporters’ Lab, Full Fact, Code for Africa, [and Meedan](https://twitter.com/PartnershipAI/status/1360261946868568065) add exceptional, varied expertise in content integrity, fact-checking, and mis/disinformation to the PAI community,” said Claire Leibowicz, who leads the AI and Media Integrity Program at Partnership on AI. “We are additionally gratified to be expanding PAI’s global reach---any meaningful solutions in this space require deep cultural awareness and nuance. We are eager to learn from this cohort.”

    “Artificial Intelligence is here to stay,” noted PAI [in announcing the new AI and Media Integrity Program](https://www.partnershiponai.org/partnership-on-ai-assembles-global-community-to-build-a-healthy-information-ecosystem/). “So, how do we use AI in a way that strengthens online discourse and ensures our public squares are of the highest quality? The work of PAI’s AI and Media Integrity Issue Area brings together those in the information integrity community---users, platforms, fact-checkers, media researchers, artists---towards the shared goal of combating the threats to public discourse that AI brings.”

    Meedan is pleased to join PAI partners such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/ "EFF"), [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/ "Mozilla"), [First Draft](https://firstdraftnews.org/), [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/), and the [Wikimedia Foundation.](https://wikimediafoundation.org/ "Wikimedia Foundation") Learn more about the partnership [here.](https://www.partnershiponai.org/partnership-on-ai-assembles-global-community-to-build-a-healthy-information-ecosystem/)

    ### Elections can be a challenging time for fact-checkers, given the potential impact of false and misleading political information on democratic processes. Our fact-checking partners have already braced themselves for fierce and difficult elections in the months to come. 

    Election fact-checking comes with its own complexities. In India, the diversity of languages, cultural contexts and subnational political landscapes add to the challenges of monitoring and addressing misinformation, while Africa's varied political landscapes have led to mixed results for fact-checkers, ranging from favourable to completely chaotic. 

    The increasing visibility of fact-checking, as well as misleading statements put out to influence voters, are likely to further worsen the already dire situation, and with five elections lined up in India and a host of elections in Africa scheduled for 2021, our partners have already devised their plans to tackle misinformation. 

    __[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check)__ : According to Balkrishna, the editor at India Today Fact Check, the Eastern state of West Bengal is likely to see a significant amount of content that aims to polarize voters. The state has a track record of the worst kind of election violence and we can already see the charged up atmosphere there. According to Balkrishna, the Southern state of Kerala is similar to West Bengal in terms of having a sizable minority population and this makes it a fit case for communal politics. In the state of Assam in the North East, [the National Register of Citizens](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/what-is-nrc-all-you-need-to-know-about-national-register-of-citizens-1629195-2019-12-18) (NRC) is a big political issue and India Today Fact Check anticipates misinformation around [The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/citizenship-amendment-bill-2019-parliament-winter-session-nrc-6122846/) and NRC to be used to reap votes.

    India Today Fact Check has already ramped up their capabilities in West Bengal and have hired team members based in the state capital Kolkata to deal with this important election. India Today is also starting fact- checking in Malayalam, the language used by majority people in Kerala, to cater to the needs of people in the state. At both state levels, India Today already has its bureaus and a network of local reporters who would be involved for on- ground verification of facts.

    __[BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in/)__ will be following all the state elections, and they believe that West Bengal will be the most crucial election of the year. They have a team of 5 reporters based in the state who are monitoring content both online and offline. BOOM also publishes content in [Bengali language](https://bangla.boomlive.in/), and their focus is on misinformation emerging out of the pre-election rallies and political realignments that are taking place in the state. Given the dynamic between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party at the centre in India and Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in West Bengal, BOOM expects to see false narratives and misinformation featuring these dynamics prominently. They intend to produce text stories, simple explainers and videos explaining what is happening in the state. 

    __[Factly](https://factly.in/)__, which works prominently in India's Telugu-speaking Southern states, plans to look out for misinformation around elections, but also focus on improving authentic information around election processes in general. They are anticipating voter fraud, as well as misleading information on where to vote, voter lists, and electronic voter machines (EVMs). They also expect misinformation around the work done by state and central governments. 

    __[AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/)__ has also prioritized the West Bengal election, and plans to grow their Bengali-speaking fact-checking team. They will also use CrowdTangle to monitor misinformation and deploy Facebook ads in regional languages to promote their tipline. 

    Jagran Media's __[Vishvas News](https://www.vishvasnews.com/)__ plans a major campaign around misinformation in the election states and will disseminate fact-checked information in local languages. As they have done in previous elections, they will conduct media and information literacy programs for citizens to introduce basic fact-checking tools for members of the public to become fact-checkers in their own social circles.

    __[PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)__, our newest 3PFC partner based in Kenya and with a presence in 12 African countries, had some experience fact-checking elections in Tanzania and Uganda in October 2020 and January 2021 respectively. The most significant election coming up for them is Ethiopia in June 2021. The main challenge that they have faced is that the internet shutdowns have become more prevalent before, during, and immediately after elections in Africa. In response to this, the PesaCheck team plans to work with people on the ground in the countries they operate in, and in the event that the local fact-checker is unreachable, they intend to have an alternate on the team versed in the country in question. To do this, they position the fact-checkers they have close to the countries and within the regions where these elections are happening, for example in Mali during the election in Niger, to help out.
