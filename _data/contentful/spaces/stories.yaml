    In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

    Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

    ## Check in India

    In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

    ![A snapshot of Check in action in India](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7ByjlM8ANw0DQKaFgilv7k/75663509b60dee23c990ceea2696068a/check-in-india.png)

    In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

    The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

    In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months. For more about Checkpoint, [click here](https://medium.com/@meedan/press-release-new-whatsapp-tip-line-launched-to-understand-and-respond-to-misinformation-during-f4fce616adf4).

    ## Check in Indonesia

    In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

    Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

    > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

    ## Check in the Philippines

    The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

    The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
    “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

    In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

    Conversations on family WhatsApp groups in India can be exhausting. *“Your bank has gone bust. Its share prices have dropped. Before you lose your life savings, find a reliable bank and transfer all your money.”* My anxious family members shared this message on one of our many family WhatsApp groups.

    The language and style of the message looked dubious to me. A few inquiries and one good fact-check relieved me: My bank was safe! Before I could share the good news on the family group, there was another forward that family members did not want anyone to miss. A big chocolate brand was gifting free chocolate hampers for Diwali! Before I could alert family members to not fall for the new hoax, there was mayhem on the group. The number of chocolate boxes purportedly being gifted increased with each message! So my little alert was buried in an avalanche of chocolate discussion among very excited young and old members of my family.

    Studies have shown that trust in the person sharing a message on closed messaging apps like WhatsApp is a key indicator of the message being shared multiple times. It is because of this trust that even suspicious looking messages are spread. I often talk with friends about this; *“What is the right strategy to call out family members sending fake news on WhatsApp groups?” “I can’t stop being Judge Judy on my family WhatsApp groups and people hate me for that.” “The last time I told my uncle his message was fake, he made a nasty comment and ignored me at the next family gathering.”*

    From first-hand experience running newsrooms, I can tell you that fact-checkers in India face similar concerns to my friends and I. I once met a media marketing manager who managed 60 WhatsApp groups. I wondered how he kept track of important messages. Shortly after that interaction, my newsroom went from print to digital, and I found myself on at least 40 WhatsApp groups that had media persons and other local professionals. The barrage of good morning messages did not stop until early evening. Group members were happy to share all kinds of unsolicited advice about personal or professional issues. Birthdays and anniversaries are big in India, and wishes, memes, songs on these occasions started from midnight and never ended! Amidst all this, fake information filtered into these groups as well. It was nearly impossible to keep track of conversations and information.

    What is the solution to this? Will we just learn to live surrounded by a fog of noise and misinformation?

    *“There’s a lot of noise on WhatsApp. Ignoring it is not an option; this is the pulse of conversations around us today. Addressing it is a challenge because of the clutter.”* My conversations with fact-checkers in India indicate high levels of exhaustion just from monitoring incoming messages on WhatsApp. Many of them work with limited resources and small teams. Managing a helpline on WhatsApp is not easy; from employment related inquiries to requests for setting up appointments with celebrities — fact-checkers have dealt with it all. There’s also video calls from users at all hours, pornographic content, trolls, these are also concerns flagged by fact-checkers in India.

    So how do fact-checking initiatives cope with this? Well…

    - Some have had to discontinue their helplines
    - Others have to scroll through several messages to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones
    - Fact-checkers are also relying on other social media platforms to look for relevant information to address. “We can’t not address misinformation on WhatsApp”, the last fact-checker I met said.

    #### Check is here to help!

    Meedan’s digital tool, Check, has features that can provide solutions to messages on closed apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was introduced to Check last year when I learned about Verificado, a collaborative election reporting and fact-checking project in Mexico. In March this year I was actively using Check while working on Checkpoint, a research project around the 2019 Indian general election where Check integrated with the WhatsApp Business API.

    As a Check journalist, there are many tasks that the tool simplified

    - I didn’t have to look at a WhatsApp number everyday to find relevant election related messages
    - It was possible for me to collaborate with other team members, even those members who were not physically present in the same space, because we all had access to the same feed
    - Finding important messages buried in a heap of junk also became easier because of Check
    - Keeping track of work and looking at patterns of misinformation was another task where different features of Check came in handy.

    I saw the potential of Check to perform many more tasks to help fact-checkers, journalists, activists and researchers. As a team member leading Meedan’s work in the Asia Pacific region, I am now engaging with new partners and introducing Check to their workflows. I understand the concerns of journalists and fact-checkers well, and some of their concerns are now on the roadmap for Meedan’s team to improve Check and enhance its features. As a Meedan team member, I understand how Check can be positioned in the work of organizations and how its existing features can be applied effectively. It’s a dynamic relationship and it’s a good place to be in.

    Before I joined Meedan as a software engineer in late 2011, this amazing team had already noticed that new media was ending the scarcity in which mass media journalism functioned. This was having repercussions for both newsgathering and publishing—no longer were audiences solely reliant on foreign reporters to tell the story. This was particularly true of the reporting of the Middle East, where citizen media been used so powerfully in the midst of such colossal social and political change during the Arab Spring. And citizen media should be verified.

    That’s when Meedan started working on this problem — clearly a very difficult nut to crack. It all started with a participatory liveblog with leading Egyptian independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm.

    ![The Early Days: Checkdesk 1.0](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1pyqrBpzaGsslnQzRhWQbq/99411e1d90054d975042df1d3243377a/1_vhGxiy0adssnlxAxPYO91Q.png)

    Less than one year after I joined Meedan, around October 2012, the software engineering team (myself included) started working on a second iteration of this platform for collaborative fact-checking, which at that point was called Checkdesk, which we launched in July 2013.

    Checkdesk was a verification desk for the digital newsroom, designed to help curate user-generated content during breaking news and to connect journalists to citizen sources on the ground. We developed it in cooperation with six leading media outlets in the MENA region: Al Masry Al Youm and Welad El Balad Media Services in Egypt, 7iber in Jordan, Nahar Ashabab and Social Media Exchange (SMEX) in Lebanon, Ma’an Network in Palestine, and Al-Ayyam in Syria.

    ![Checkdesk 2.0 in action by Bellingcat](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/5hGviBzBImRaJ9H6kj2QvJ/6f2de5304cc654ba0983ec1a96bab305/1_v1g4OUFLKHmvwSv_ChhYRQ.gif)

    From a technological perspective, Checkdesk was built as a monolithic web application using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), an open source platform for web content management. As a CMS, Drupal was among the most successful and seemed like a great fit for our needs, because it strikes a great balance between getting up and running in no time, and the ability to extend its functionality almost infinitely. It served us quite well between 2013 and early 2016 and during that time we had the opportunity to [make numerous contributions to its community](https://www.drupal.org/node/2343639) and attend some Drupal conferences to share all the expertise we gained with that work.

    As our applications grew, we started facing scalability challenges with Drupal. These challenges manifested in many ways, from code maintainability to lower performance, proliferation of defects and automated testing. It was time for us to rethink our software architecture. We had to implement more features, go mobile, support more languages, handle more content, serve more users and face new social events—mainly elections.

    We accepted a big challenge at that time, which was to completely rewrite Checkdesk, in six months, from scratch, with a completely new code base.

    Personally, I had some good pre-Meedan experience with the open source web application framework [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) since 2009. During my early days at Meedan I had the opportunity to implement a prototype in Ruby On Rails for social media translation, which was called Translatedesk. This prototype evolved into a micro services architecture made of several Ruby On Rails APIs which were at the core of our translation product, [Bridge](https://meedan.com/en/bridge/).

    So we decided to pursue a similar software stack approach as Bridge and re-implemented Checkdesk as a multi-service application: some [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs written in Ruby On Rails, a web application using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) and, as usual, everything was released [as an open source project](https://github.com/meedan/check). We also started a new culture for our software development process, which includes writing automated tests for everything seeking [100% code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa/code), [continuous testing](http://travis-ci.org/meedan), [code quality with maximum GPA at Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/58bdc058359261025a0020fa) and containerization of our softwares.

    Not only the code was rewritten, but also the branding: Checkdesk was brought out from behind the ‘desk.’ The 3.0 version of our open source software was rebranded as, simply, [Check](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    ![Checkdesk 3.0, a.k.a. Check](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1Dkor8b2zPH26RZptleGDl/da47acfd15d8a1a4ec964482baa491fb/1_pcz3ZoK-tD_C9gnM2CCpnw.png)

    Check provides a central workbench facilitating online verification newsroom collaboration, allowing participating journalists and editors a simple and powerful framework to work together to investigate and annotate links, media and claims. This new code base has been serving us well since then, and during that time we implemented many improvements, new features and performance enhancements in order to accommodate its increasing usage. Since we first released it in October 2016, it was used by OJA-winning election monitoring projects like [Electionland](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/checking-the-vote-how-check-was-used-during-electionland-4242dd875e4b) (United States, 2016), [CrossCheck](https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.org/france-fr/) (France, 2017) and [Verificado](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/verificado-2018-wins-major-collaboration-and-partnerships-award-e6812ecbbdf) (Mexico, 2018), in addition to similar projects in Asia, namely [Indonesia, Philippines and India](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/meedan-in-asia-how-check-supported-three-simultaneous-election-reporting-initiatives-9b6626e89e3a).

    In India we had a new big challenge to face: misinformation on WhatsApp. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/). In December 2018 we started to integrate Check into the WhatsApp business API and released this feature in early April 2019, just in time for the elections in India. Check Message was born: our tool for fact-checking against disinformation at scale, seeking scalability, reliability and great performance.

    ![Check Message architecture](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4YDeFFaKebhPeh3N1xAt9p/f3f144a5e8ebbd10c083377b3db57b89/1_QEFoJ2yG5LvjfQVew-oPyA.png)

    Our collaboration in India, called [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched in April as the first real use case of Check Message. In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification and our software was useful to group duplicate requests, allow similar items to be related, prioritize most requested items and, in general, optimize the fact-checker’s work as much as possible.

    ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

    After this first release, we generalized our software module from WhatsApp-specific to more platform-agnostic, and we now support other closed message platforms, like Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger. This module was implemented as a Check bot. Check allows for extensible scripts and functions that help you augment your verification experience with tools like private messenger integration, archiving and language detection. We call these scripts [bots](https://github.com/meedan/check-bots), and they live in the [Bot Garden](https://medium.com/meedan-user-guides/bot-garden-user-guide-adc2c1d743f3). We hope that this bot infrastructure can be used by other developers around the world to integrate Check with other tools and with their own workflows.

    We keep working on Check in order to improve user experience, content ingestion and augmented verification. Stay tuned! What I can say is that I’m really enjoying the things we are working on right now and really excited for the next challenges we’ll face and the new software support we’ll implement in the upcoming years in order to make Check even more global. I invite everyone to join us on that. If you are a software developer interested in open source and in these challenges we’re tackling, get in touch on [GitHub](http://github.com/meedan). If you are journalist and want to use Check for your project, get in touch with us on our [website](https://meedan.com/en/check/).

    Ultimately, it’s a collaborative effort.

  body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
    misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
    content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
    since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
    published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election, to
    the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
    before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
    (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
    the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
    credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
    an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of it
    are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how to
    communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for content
    credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
    to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
    of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an initiative
    with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community group (CredWeb).
    [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
    (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
    to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
    documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
    to this issue.\n\n#### [Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment
    on the Web](https://credweb.org/report/20181011)\n\nThis is a vision document
    that captures a general technical approach for improving credibility assessment
    online. It captures everything from terminology to threat models and stakeholders,
    and it lays out some of our core vision for the potential of these standards.
    It’s a hefty lift, and we recommend taking some time to look through it and offer
    commentary.\n\nHere’s how it starts:\n\n*Can you tell, when looking at a random
    web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search
    results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are
    scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed
    and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda or outright lies?
    Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making
    some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods with
    your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making
    bad decisions for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous
    consequences?*\n\n*The Credible Web Community Group was formed at W3C, the organization
    which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological approaches
    to this “credibility assessment” problem. It’s not that we think technology can
    solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one,
    but it seems likely that some technology is making matters worse and that certain
    designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches
    to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.*\n\n\n#### [Credibility
    Signals](https://credweb.org/signals/)\n\nAfter reading through the above, it
    helps to dive into specifics. What do signals look like? In this document, we
    have an outline of some draft signals. They range from signals around rhetoric
    — does it show negative or positive valence? — to a typology around clickbait
    and what it means for a title to accurately represent the body content.\n\nHere’s
    how we frame the document:\n\n*This document is intended to support an ecosystem
    of interoperable credibility tools. These software tools, which may be components
    of familiar existing systems, will gather, process, and use relevant data to help
    people more accurately decide what information they can trust online and protect
    themselves from being misled. We expect that an open data-sharing architecture
    will facilitate efficient research and development, as well as an overall system
    which is more visibly trustworthy.*\n\n*The document has three primary audiences:*\n\n-
    *Software developers and computer science researchers wanting to build systems
    which work with credibility data. For them, the document aims to be a precise
    technical specification, stating what they need for their software to interoperate
    with any other software which conforms to this specification.*\n- *People who
    work in journalism and want to review and contribute to this technology sphere,
    to help make sure it is beneficial and practical.*\n- *Non-computer-science researchers,
    interested in helping develop and improve the science behind this work.*\n\nWe’re
    grateful to the many many participants who gave feedback on these documents in
    their early stages, and we’re looking forward to advancing them in our second
    year as a group. If you’re coming to [CredCon](http://www.credcon.org/), be sure
    to join our workshops and chat with CredWeb co-chair Sandro Hawke. Or, learn more
    about joining the group at [credweb.org](http://credweb.org/).\n\n\n\n\n"

    Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

    ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

    We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

    ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

    Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

    ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

    With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

    ![“Aerial Photos of flooding caused by Hurricane Florence” by S.C. Air National Guard](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3FLP519tmwF4fE0nWhoYaB/0747fcb183e0af1ddabf57d2e4c086d8/1_WUPR5tVJFJ_Z-X9hEhkPFQ.jpeg)

    ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

    The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

    ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

    Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.

  body: "Meedan is a global organization. Our name speaks to gathering - in a number
    of languages the Meedan, Maydan, Maidan, etc is the town square. Our work, too,
    is about gathering people. We recognized very early that misinformation is a global
    challenge and so response projects need to be global.  We run training sessions,
    host convenings, bring together large scale monitoring projects, and have network
    partners across 14 time zones; our work is about connecting people, crossing borders,
    gathering in the squares. \n\nIt is remarkable that this truly global collaboration
    to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve is explicitly a global anti(in-person)-gathering.
    In Meedan terms: the future of our global town squares is dependent on our near
    term efforts to keep our physical town squares empty, and our digital town squares
    free of dangerous misinformation. \n\nAs we confront the reality of the COVID-19
    pandemic we are addressing the immediate needs of a global team and also working
    to develop programs that contribute to the global COVID-19 response. \n\nFollowing
    the lead of some other [inspiring organizations](https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikimedia-coronavirus-response-people-first-8bd99ea6214b
    \"Wikimedia Foundation\"), today, we have withdrawn limits on sick days and personal
    paid leave that our team members might need to care for a child whose school has
    been cancelled or to care for disabled or vulnerable family members. We have closed
    our offices, cancelled all planned travel and meetings, and have put a hold on
    the Check Global Investigative Camp in Tunisia and CheckCon EU.   \n\nLast week
    we sent a memo to our Check Global partners outlining our support for their health
    and well-being and a request that they revisit work plans, budgets, and project
    timelines in light of COVID-19. We did this with the consent and encouragement
    of funders including Omidyar Network and the Swedish Development Cooperation Agency.
    \ \n\nWe are also working on specific programmatic responses. Last year we launched
    the Meedan Digital Health Lab with a focus on access to health information as
    a health equity issue.  My colleagues An Xiao Mina and Nat Gyenes framed some
    of our rationale for starting this lab in a prescient piece in the Atlantic, [How
    Misinfodemics Spread Disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/
    \"Misinfodemics\"), in which they coined the term misinfodemics. As numerous international
    bodies have identified misinformation as one of the most actionable areas for
    civil society and governmental work, we are building a coalition with epidemiologists,
    public health communications experts, technology companies, and civil society
    partners to create a database of COVID-19 facts and a repository of annotated
    misinformation.  \n\nWe have moved a significant percentage of our Check Global,
    Digital Health Lab and CryptoChat research program energies into this new program
    area beginning immediately. \n\nAgainst the very tangible threat to our emotional
    and physical well-being, I want to close this brief statement by saying perhaps
    this global project to stay apart might actually serve to bring together a world
    that is riven politically and ideologically. It’s going to take some brilliant
    and heroic collaborations to make it through the next several months and we are
    committed to doing what we can as an organization placed at the epicenter of misinformation
    response and digital health. \n\nEpidemiologist? Public Health Expert? Talented
    Engineer? [Post-doc Researcher](https://meedan.com/jobs/research-fellow/ \"Meedan
    Job Posting\")? Email us at hello@meedan.com if you want to lend a hand with the
    formidable task of getting high quality COVID-19 info onto the interwebs while
    we rebuild this plane inflight and work through a new way of running a coronavirus
    resistant organization.\n\nEAB<br/>\nMarch 16, 2020<br/>\nWoodacre, CA"

  body: "April is usually a very busy month for Meedan. While our partners work remotely
    most of the year, conferences are concentrated bursts of productivity for journalists,
    fact-checkers, and civic tech developers. The emergence of COVID–19, the novel
    coronavirus, has led to the cancellation of most conferences focusing on Internet
    freedom, journalism, and technology. \n\n[Check](https://meedan.com/check), the
    project we were hoping to present in person, is being used to address everything
    from health misinformation to political disinformation, on platforms like WhatsApp,
    Twitter and YouTube. In the midst of our work, we’ve seen a rising trend in COVID-19-related
    content, and  public health and science communication experts have been helping
    us respond to this pandemic, as fact-checkers use Check to ensure  accurate information
    can be returned to places where rumors and inaccurate health information usually
    spread. \n\nWe don’t want to put our communities at risk, but this year it’s more
    critical for us to accomplish what we usually do at conferences. While we are
    disappointed that we won’t be seeing our colleagues in person, there’s an opportunity
    here. There have always been many reasons to have a virtual conference, but now
    there are more people and organizations motivated to do something about it - there
    are entire industries going virtual. At Meedan, we strongly value equity, diversity
    and inclusion amongst both staff and partners. If we work on this issue during
    a pandemic, we can make conferences more accessible for everyone as a long term
    goal too. Participants from emerging economies often have difficulty getting visas
    to attend conferences. Global climate change has led several people to forgo airplane
    travel. Parents have to skip conferences when childcare isn’t available. Some
    disabilities make travel difficult, and the disability activism community has
    long called for improvements to technology for remote participation.\n\nRemote
    participation has been used by several conferences to enable attendance for people
    who cannot travel. While this has been effective for panelists, purely virtual
    conferences are not widespread, and they lack virtual versions of useful conference
    activities. Many of the open source tools we use were designed by covering walls
    in a massive number of sticky notes. \n\nThis is an invitation to you all. What
    do you need from a virtual conference? What do you think of existing solutions?
    What works for you, and what doesn’t? Do we need to work on something new? \n\nWe
    started with the activities we find useful:\n\n1. Presenting talks and slides\n\n2.
    Presenting product demos\n\n3. Audience questions\n\n4. Breakout sessions\n\n5.
    One-on-one discussions\n\n6. Introducing conference participants to each other\n\n7.
    Un-conference formats\n\n8. The equivalents of whiteboards and sticky notes\n\nWe
    came up with some user stories. Many of the virtual conference tools we’ve looked
    at were designed for big tech companies. Big commercial conferences have massive
    budgets and lax privacy policies. Our usual conferences have small budgets and
    high levels of security awareness. For instance, many of us wear lanyards that
    indicate that we don’t want our photos taken. Here are some of the people we’re
    thinking of. If we have left something out, let us know! \n\n1. This participant
    has a compromised immune system. Any conference involves risk. Disclosing a disability,
    however, is not always feasible. Because remote participation is not an option
    at many conferences, they cannot perform their job without traveling. As long
    as there are ways to watch talks, submit questions, and communicate with other
    participants, this person's needs are met.\n\n2. This participant lives in a region
    or country with limited access to a fast Internet connection. Any virtual conference
    technology has to take low bandwidth environments into account.\n\n3. This participant
    has a passport or legal status that makes it difficult for them to travel. They
    often get rejected for visas, even when they are a featured speaker at a conference.
    \n\n3. This participant lives in a country that censors the Internet and arrests
    journalists. In order to participate safely, they can only go to conferences with
    a no photo or video policy, whether this is a blanket ban or attendee preferences
    can be signaled by the color of their conference lanyard. Any virtual conference
    technology must allow private access, allowances for pseudonyms, participation
    without voice or video, and possibly compatibility with censorship circumvention
    technologies.\n\n4. This participant is Deaf. Their technology needs may include
    live captioning, participation by typing, a sign language interpreter, clear video
    of presenters to enable lip reading, or clear audio from participants depending
    on their level of hearing and their own accessibility technology.\n\n5. This participant
    is blind. Virtual conference software needs to be compatible with screen readers,
    and presenters should consult with an accessibility coordinator to make any of
    their presentation materials compatible.\n\n6. This participant may have problems
    understanding one or more of the conference languages. They may need live translation,
    or just subtitles in order to cope with various accents and dialects. \n\n7. The
    participant is a caregiver and cannot always log in at the exact time of the presentation.
    They may need transcription or access to recordings, with the ability to ask questions
    of the presenter at a later time.\n\n8. People who need mobility aids face obstacles
    when traveling. Wheelchair users often get broken chairs back from airlines. When
    these chairs are custom fit, there are no temporary replacements that can make
    participating in a conference a pain-free experience. Power wheelchairs are very
    expensive, so travel can mean gambling with one’s mobility for a long time after
    a conference. \n\n9. This participant has modest tech skills and may need help
    with operating the interface for online meetings. Usability is an access issue.
    \n\nWe’re working with our communities to make lasting change out of this emergency
    situation. The civic tech community is evaluating software and practices for conferences
    and hackathons. We’re also expanding our online developer community. Let’s build
    something together! \n\nEmail us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>
    to get started. "

  body: "During 2019, as we grew our Check Global program with the generous support
    of the [Swedish International Development Agency](https://www.sida.se/English/)
    ([Sida](https://www.sida.se/English/)), Meedan expanded its partnership footprint
    to Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Shalini Joshi, Isabella Barroso, and
    Wafaa Heikal make our all-women superstar, program leads team working with newsrooms,
    fact-checkers, feminist networks and academic groups across three continents.\n\nThis
    represents significant growth from previous years, allowing us to deepen our support
    for these regions with program leads who are deeply familiar with their local
    contexts and who can provide ongoing support for our amazing partners around the
    world. We are pleased to introduce two new regional leads, along with Wafaa Heikal,
    our long-running program manager who is now heading up our efforts in Africa and
    the Western Asia regions.\n\n### Meet Shalini Joshi in India\n\nShalini Joshi
    is passionate about feminism and local journalism. Over the last two decades,
    her work has brought the two together. Shalini has studied misinformation, particularly
    on closed messaging platforms. She has been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the [International
    Center for Journalists](https://www.icfj.org/) ([ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/)).
    The fellowship focused on designing creative ways to counter misinformation. As
    a specialist at [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/), ICFJ's partner in India, Shalini
    led [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/) - a research project focused
    on misinformation in the Indian elections. \n\nShalini started her professional
    journey with [Nirantar](http://www.nirantar.net/), a centre for gender education.
    She trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented communities to come
    into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes. Shalini is
    the co-founder of [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (“News Waves”
    in Hindi), an independent digital rural news network. Khabar Lahariya is known
    for its groundbreaking journalism and its journalists — a team of women from some
    of the most underserved communities of rural North India. The project is a testament
    to the fact that in a democracy like India, local and independent media is essential,
    as any other service, in small towns and rural areas.\n\nShalini believes that
    [Check](https://meedan.com/check) and its future iterations can be a turning point
    for journalists aiming to study and counter misinformation shared on closed messaging
    platforms. Newsrooms can use the platforms to curate, annotate, verify and archive
    misinformation and Shalini believes that for several small and independent newsrooms,
    this is a great service that no other platform currently provides. Check has tremendous
    potential for newsrooms and fact-checkers to design collaborative projects, especially
    around areas of common interest. Its unique features are great for large projects
    on politics, health, climate change or those that track human rights issues. \n\n\n###
    Meet Isabella Barroso in Brazil\n\nIsabella Barroso, also known to many as Isa,
    is Meedan's Latin America regional program manager. She works with several newsrooms
    in both Spanish and Portuguese spanning Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIsa joins Meedan's
    program team with a passion for human-centred design and product development that
    is fit to solve problems. After two degrees in journalism and interaction design,
    Isa hopes that her dual expertise in both journalism and her technical skills
    in product management and design will help bridge the intersection of society,
    journalism and technology.\n\nIn Latin America, our Check Global partners are
    [Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/about/), present in 18 countries
    and [Animal Político](https://www.animalpolitico.com/) in México.\n\n> I am now
    developing more of my program skills based on my experience in product,\" noted
    Isabella. \"I am interested in social development and impact. I learned a lot
    about how to scale processes in different contexts and at Meedan this happens
    with each partner or new venture.\n\nMisinformation in Latin America seems to
    be as decentralised as the open web. It's systemised, coordinated messaging on
    closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, rumours and what seems to be an information
    overflow to disorient information consumers.\n\n### Meet Wafaa Heikal in Berlin\n\nWafaa
    Heikal graduated in 2011 from Cairo University and received a bachelor’s in journalism.
    She loves fiction and thought journalism  is an excellent proxy to literature.
    \n\n> “My focus was following the interactions of youth with culture and social
    media after the revolution,\" she’s said. \n\nWafaa's first job was as a culture
    journalist at [Akhbar El Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al-Adab),
    due to her love for fiction and literature. \n\nHer inspiration to be a journalist
    came directly from her participation as a student activist in the Egyptian revolution
    of 2011.  \n\n> Through journalism I felt I could do more than just participate;
    I could contribute to the movement. \n\nThe move to open source investigations,
    open media projects and university-based journalism efforts was a way of expressing
    the goals and values of the revolution. \n \nWafaa had worked in local and regional
    media for years, and she is now one of Meedan’s regional program managers, working
    with newsrooms which often are not fully prepared  for the speed of the news cycle.
    In this role, Wafaa helps to build fact-checking collaborations to monitor and
    verify social media during elections, and supports fact-checkers and human rights
    researchers work in verifying user generated content using Meedan verification,
    annotation and translation tools.\n \nWafaa sees immense potential for Meedan’s
    open source tools.\n\n> “I use [Check](https://meedan.com/check) to support different
    workflows depending  on what types of content we want to investigate and what
    context we are working in - its great that our tools allow for work across an
    interesting range of use cases... However, I really like working with small teams
    and small newsrooms around the globe on our  elections monitoring projects, understanding
    the particular national context and partner capacities and then designing new
    workflows around them.”\n\n"

  body: "Sifting through an onslaught of misinformation and competing narratives is
    one of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 health crisis. Meedan is working
    with fact-checking groups across the globe to debunk misleading health claims
    and support responsible verification efforts in many contexts. Our public health
    expert, Nat Gyenes, put together some critical tips for fact-checking pandemic-related
    information, building from the report we released a few months ago on [responsible
    health fact-checking](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf). \n\nFive tips for
    fact-checking information during a pandemic:\n\n__1. Reference the date and time
    at which you accessed the health information used to fact-check.__ This ensures
    that users know the information is only valid up to that date and time. Including
    specific time zones might be useful as well. The World Health Organization hosts
    daily media briefings in which recommendations to governments or countries may
    change, and it is important to communicate with your target audiences the exact
    point of relevance of the information that you are disseminating. \n\n__2. Be
    context-specific when responding to treatment and prevention strategy queries.__
    For questions about specific treatment or prevention strategies, such as questions
    about whether  antibiotics are used to treat COVID-19 (they’re not*), respond
    to whether they have been tested or validated in the COVID-19 context only. This
    ensures that the fact-check response doesn’t resemble a clinical recommendation,
    and avoids possibly harmful references to other contexts in which particular treatments
    have been effective.\n\n__3. Reference the source of the health information you
    use to fact check.__ It may be important to clarify whether the information you
    have received was verified by an infectious disease professional, as opposed to
    publicly accessible information on the website of a health information authority,
    such as the World Health Organization or national department of health sources.
    This can help provide guidance to your audience members as they search for additional
    information or context online. \n\n__4. Use disclaimer text to ensure transparency
    with users about the changing nature of information in a pandemic.__ We drafted
    a sample disclaimer text that you can include in fact-checks to help communicate
    to users the ever-changing nature of information in a pandemic: \n\n> “We base
    our COVID-19 fact-checks on information provided by internationally-    recognized
    health organizations and health professionals. Because information in   epidemics
    is constantly being updated, our fact-checks are up to date based on the date
    and time they are published. If you're looking for medical advice, please contact
    a healthcare provider, and be sure to review the World Health Organization website
    for more information about COVID-19: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\n__5.
    Consider clinical requests to be out of scope: Avoid providing any clinical recommendations
    to your audience.__ The disclaimer text above should help with that. If there
    are specific personal medical questions which your audience wants answered, they
    can be responded to with a subset of the disclaimer text above:  \n\n>   “If you're
    looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare provider, and   be sure
    to review the World Health Organization website for more information about COVID-19:
    https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019”\n\nAs the COVID-19
    pandemic and misinfodemic continues to spread across continents and screens, drastically
    impacting public health, our way of life and global markets, Meedan is also reflecting
    on this historic moment and its emerging lessons: In the coming weeks we will
    be releasing a series of analyses on COVID-19, written by journalists, fact-checkers,
    censorship experts, thought leaders and academics. The contributors are writing
    about the pandemic through the fog of the war— filing reports and analyses as
    news is still breaking, long before we know how the story of COVID-19 ends. \n\nThe
    analyses will aim to shine a light on topics like disaster diplomacy, censorship,
    localization of information access, and public trust, as we start to think about
    moving forward and away from the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this
    in our newsletter and on social media. \n\n*\"No, antibiotics do not work against
    viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore,
    antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However,
    if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because
    bacterial co-infection is possible\"\n\n"

  body: "Global fact-checking organizations and pandemic communicators are fielding
    massive amounts of complex information requests about COVID-19. Meedan's Digital
    Health Lab is announcing the development of an emergency response resource to
    support pandemic fact-checking efforts. \n\nThrough our network of public health
    researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists, we are developing
    a database of information related to COVID-19 that is contextualized, populated
    and regularly updated by public health experts, including epidemiologists and
    infectious disease researchers. This resource can be used as source material for
    journalists and fact-checkers who are working to verify and contextualize pandemic-related
    information. \n\nLimited access to public health experts can present a bottleneck
    for fact-checkers and journalists, especially during emergencies, when demand
    for those experts is high. Over the last six years, first at the Harvard School
    of Public Health and now at Meedan's Digital Health Lab, I have been researching
    how health information inequity and digital health misinformation can impact the
    spread and burden of disease, as well as the communication gaps that can exacerbate
    those issues. In December 2019, we [published a report](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
    on how responsible health fact-checking requires a unique standard of care. \n\nIt
    is increasingly clear, and is demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic, that
    two twin challenges need support:\n\n1) Fact-checking organizations, journalists
    and other communicators are working tirelessly to answer questions about complex
    health situations and disease distribution, and to explain medical research and
    epidemiological findings\n\n2) Public health practitioners and infectious disease
    researchers struggle to urgently communicate their expertise effectively to a
    wide, general audience \n\nThis resource of aggregated expert-sourced information
    is designed to complement fact-checking database efforts, like Poynter’s excellent
    CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronavirus Alliance, First Draft’s Reporter Hub resources,
    and Google’s Fact Check Explorer. Where these databases focus on the first challenge
    — helping fact-checkers and journalists do their jobs more effectively — the second
    challenge needs more critical support. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is supplying
    important health expert perspectives on key COVID-19 issues. We plan to utilize
    ClaimReview and MediaReview to make sure the content we generate can be shared
    readily amongst others. \n\nWe are also integrating this database into fact-checking
    bot workflows that many of our partners are already using to source questions
    from the public, adding an option for wider audiences to either access existing
    resources relevant to COVID-19, or to submit their queries to be fact-checked.
    This added option of reaching local fact-checking organizations directly, and
    providing localized responses, complements the incredibly valuable initiatives
    being developed by the World Health Organization, and various health ministries
    around the world, working together to strengthen access to quality information
    through the pandemic. \n\nWith support from the Google News Initiative, Twitter,
    Facebook, Omidyar Network, the Swedish International Development Agency and the
    Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we have designed an initiative centered around
    six pillars of work: \n \n__Data:__ During breaking news, limited access to experts
    can create bottlenecks. This resource can scale fact-checkers’ abilities to access
    reliable sources for urgent expertise by providing content that is populated and
    regularly updated by experts. Through a growing list of publicly sourced questions
    and expert-sourced answers, this resource can also help intergovernmental health
    organizations understand the greatest and most urgent communication needs during
    the pandemic. \n\n__Network:__ Meedan has assembled a distributed global network
    of epidemiologists and global public health experts to build and maintain the
    database. To streamline the process of ‘expert-seeking,’ which fact-checkers and
    communicators regularly go through, we developed a triage system that organizes
    COVID-19 questions into several groups, based on:\n\n- Potential for impacting
    public health outcomes\n- Timeliness and/or urgency\n- Area of health expertise
    required to respond appropriately \n\n__Impact Assessment:__ As we continue to
    collaborate on projects that address emerging threats with new technologies and
    evolving workflows, we are committed to centralizing research in impact assessment,
    monitoring and evaluation into the earliest parts of project design. In addition
    to our team of public health and user researchers, we are fortunate to be working
    with experts in monitoring and evaluation from Birmingham City University, as
    well as the Behavioural Insights Team, to better understand the behavioral impact
    of our response efforts, and to drive project workflows, database priorities and
    content design. We are prioritizing a localized and feminist COVID-19 response
    effort.  \n\n__Communications:__ It is key for this initiative  to bridge research
    and practice, and for insights to be actionable for communicators. We are developing
    templates for packaged, verified content that can be included in outputs sent
    from fact-checkers to their audiences. The packages are grounded in behavior science
    and our efforts to develop health-specific standards of care for communications,
    and include best practices for addressing health information response challenges,
    such as competing expert perspectives, consistency, and transparency in the ever-changing
    information ecosystem of pandemics. \n\n__Technology:__ We are prioritizing pathways
    for disseminating contents of the database across languages to fact-checkers and
    pandemic communicators around the world. We are also integrating into Meedan’s
    open source verification and fact-checking workspace software, Check, in order
    to make its expert-reviewed contents available to the public. Through Check, we
    are creating an interface for users to design custom multilingual bots for disseminating
    their fact-checked content, connecting users to closed messaging networks including
    Facebook Messenger, Twitter Direct Message, and WhatsApp. End users will then
    be able to access a subset of relevant resources, selected by each fact-checking
    organization individually, via a simple query system, and will be presented with
    short lists of up-to-date content that matches their query.  \n \n__Research:__
    Through this project, we are examining the nature and scope of COVID-19 questions
    across languages and geographies, exploring patterns of similar themes of misinformation,
    and translating findings into useful insights for public health communicators.
    In addition, as a group that works closely with partners in emerging economies,
    Meedan is closely following the impact of the pandemic on migrants, women, people
    living in densely populated urban areas and underserved communities that don't
    have access to public health care systems. Our team members in different regions
    are tracking the impact of lockdowns on democracies, civil rights and violence
    against women, and insights will inform database priorities.\n\nAs we’re learning
    each day, information and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading
    in online ecosystems as rapidly as the virus itself is spreading around the world.
    During this historic time, the public has a wide range of time-sensitive and critical
    questions about everything from new travel restrictions to evolving infectious
    disease research. Fact-checking organizations are working tirelessly to answer
    questions about complex health information, medical research and epidemiological
    findings, while public health practitioners and infectious disease researchers
    struggle to urgently communicate their expertise to a wide general audience. The
    result of this problem set is public confusion, strained resources and often poor
    health outcomes, as low-quality online health information exacerbates the real-world
    spread of disease. Through this initiative, it is our hope to alleviate pressure
    on fact-checking organizations with limited resources and provide a needed audience
    to health experts. \n\n\nThis project builds off of years of research, including
    research on addressing health misinformation at MIT’s Center for Civic Media and
    the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, inspired by working with Dr.
    Brittany Seymour, a brilliant researcher and mentor whose early work shaped much
    of today’s health misinformation discourse, and through the founding of Meedan’s
    Digital Health Lab in 2018, a public health research unit with a goal of promoting
    health equity through digital initiatives. \n\nOver the last six years, these
    ideas have been developed, workshopped, and shared in late-night dinners and graduate
    school study sessions punctuated by ‘what-ifs’ and impromptu brainstorming, in
    sessions at SwitchPoint, the International Journalism Festival, the Digital Health
    @ Harvard series, RightsCon, MisinfoCon, and the Google News Initiative Summits,
    in fellows hours at the Berkman Klein Center, in ethics, mixed methods, and human
    rights lectures, and in conversations between friends and colleagues, hopeful
    in our ability to create something important together. I am immensely grateful
    to Meedan’s partners for showing us where we can make the most of our work together,
    and to all of our supporters as we further develop this intersection.\n\nThis
    COVID-19 response effort would not be possible without the partnership and collaboration
    of Dr. Christin Gilmer, Graphika, the Behavioural Insights Team, Birmingham City
    University, students and researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health
    and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and our network of public health
    specialists. \n\nAs we continue to build this initiative, we are keen to learn
    and collaborate. We’re grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the challenging
    and essential work that fact-checkers and communicators are doing to address this
    pandemic, and the accompanying misinfodemic. Please reach out at health@meedan.com
    to talk more.\n"

    وأزمةً صحيةً عالميةً، قد ازدادت المعلومات الصحية المُضللة والشائعات عبر منصات
    التواصل الاجتماعي، ممَّا أدى إلى تقويض الجهود المبذولة لنشر معلومات موثوقة وتم
    التحقق منها حول الفيروس. وينطوي هذا الأمر على تحدٍ خاص لمنظمات المجتمع المدني
    و التعاونيات والمجموعات الناشطة في مجال التكنولوجيا والتحقق من المعلومات التي
    تكافح من أجل فهم هذه الجائحة والتصدي لآثارها في سياقاتها المحلية. \n\nتطلق ميدان
    منح \"تشك جلوبال\" الصغيرة في محاولة منها لدعم الإعلاميين المستقلين ومدققي الحقائق
    والمواطنين الصحفيين والناشطين والعاملين في حقل التكنولوجيا والمعرفة الرقمية والتحقق
    من الأخبار في جهودهم الرامية إلى تغطية تفشي فيروس كوفيد-19 ، وتستهدف هذه المنح
    تحديداً المجموعات الناشطة في شمال أفريقيا وغرب آسيا، وأفريقيا، وأمريكا اللاتينية
    ومنطقة آسيا التي تطل على المحيط الهادئ.  \n\nوتهدف هذه المنح إلى دعم مشاريع تدقيق
    الحقائق والتحقق من الأخبار والمعلومات ومبادرات المراقبة المحلية وتوثيق يوميات
    الواقع المحلي  للمجتمعات الخاضعة للحجر الصحي وحملات التربية الإعلامية والرقمية
    وتعقب أثر منع التجول على الأنظمة الديمقراطية، وفحص تأثير الجائحة على آليات المراقبة
    التقنية، ورأسمالية المراقبة والحقوق المدنية والعنف ضد المرأة فيما يتعلق بفيروس
    كوفيد-19. وبالتالي، فإننا نشجع المتقدمين على الإبداع في مقترحاتهم. وإننا حريصون
    على دعم إنتاج أنواع مختلفة من المشروعات بما فيها البودكاست (البث الصوتي الرقمي)
    والفيديوهات والوثائقيات والمؤلفات والحملات ومجموعات الأدوات والأرشيفات الرقمية
    والتدوين. كما نتطلع إلى دعم المقترحات التي لا تركز فقط على تغطية المعلومات المضللة
    حول الجائحة، بل أيضاً النظر في حياة الناس وتجاربهم أثناء الحجر الصحي.\n\nنحن حالياً
    نقبل مقترحات بالعربية والإنجليزية والفرنسية والإسبانية والبرتغالية. وسيتم النظر
    في الطلبات بشكل دوري. . \n\n\n- يُمكن للأفراد التقدم بطلب حتى 500 دولار. \n- يُمكن
    للمنظمات التقدم بطلب حتى 2000 دولار.\n- يُمكن للمشاريع الجماعية التقدم بطلب حتى
    2500 دولار. \n\n\n### عملية تقديم الطلبات\n\n\n- ينبغي على المتقدمين ملء [[نموذجاً
    الكترونياً]](https://forms.gle/9d4pGiHuw1WnX6WL8) يصفون به مقترحهم بالتفصيل \n-
    \ تجتمع اللجنة الاستشارية للصندوق كل أسبوع لمراجعة جميع الطلبات\n- سيتم إخطار
    المتقدمين الناجحين خلال فترة من 5 إلى 10 أيام من تاريخ تقديم الطلب\n\n\n\n###
    معايير الاختيار\n- __الأصالة ودرجة الأهمية__: جودة الطلب المكتوب. ما التحديات
    التي يقترح معالجتها؟ ما منطقته الجغرافية/تركيزه الجغرافي؟\n- __قابلية التحقيق__:
    هل سيكون المتقدم قادراً على الإيفاء بوعوده المذكورة في الطلب؟ هل خطة العمل واقعية
    في الإطار الزمني المُقترح؟ هل يُمثِّل العمل الميداني أي قضايا متعلقة بالأخلاق
    والصحة والسلامة لا بد من وضعها في عين الاعتبار؟  \n- __الأثر والتعميم__: هل يحدد
    الطلب جمهوراً معنياً بالعمل؟ كيفية تخطيط العمل لتغيير التصور بشأن كوفيد-19؟ هل
    الطلب واضح من حيث سبب أهمية هذا العمل الآن؟ سيتم إعطاء الأولوية للمشاريع التي
    تخدم المجتمعات المحلية والمجتمعات المحرومة والنساء والمجموعات ثنائية الجندر و
    الأقليات، وسكان الأقاليم .\n- __الدقة__: هل ستلتزم بمنهجية تدقيق الحقائق؟ كيف
    سيتحقق المتقدم من دقة مصادره؟ هل المصادر المستخدمة في حملة التربية الإعلامية الخاصة
    بك تعد موثوقة؟\n\nالرجاء ملاحظة أنه إذا لم تتلق منا رداً خلال ثلاثة أسابيع من
    تاريخ تقديم طلبك، فهذا يعني أن طلبك غير موَّفق. ويؤسفنا القول بأنه لا يُمكننا
    على الرد على كل طلب غير موَّفق بسبب كمية الطلبات الكبيرة التي نتلقاها.  \n\nسيقوم
    المتقدمين المقبولين بنشر مشاريعهم على منصاتهم الخاصة وسيشار إليها أيضاً في صفحة
    \"تشيك جلوبال\". وسيتم إبرازها لاحقاً على مدونتنا في نهاية هذه الدورة التمويلية.

    Meedan is committed to making certain our toolkit and the code upon which it’s
    built can be utilized in service of addressing the challenges of trust, information
    quality and critical research.\n\n“This is a time for science and solidarity,\"
    explained U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres [in a recent speech](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1250095790959267841)
    establishing a new UN Communications Response Initiative. \"Yet the global 'misinfo-demic'
    is spreading…. Harmful health advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating.
    Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going viral, stigmatizing
    and vilifying people and groups.\"\n\nThe [Open COVID Pledge](https://opencovidpledge.org/pledge/)
    calls on organizations around the world to make their patents and copyrights freely
    available in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pledge was developed
    by the Open COVID Coalition, an international group of scientists and lawyers
    seeking to accelerate the rapid development and deployment of diagnostics, vaccines,
    therapeutics, medical equipment and software solutions in this urgent public health
    crisis. \n\nMeedan thanks the organizers of the Open COVID Pledge and is proud
    to join this effort, recognizing the value that the exchange of technology and
    ideas can bring to our work. All our code is made available under an [MIT open
    source license](https://github.com/meedan/check/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt), including
    [Check](https://github.com/meedan/check), our collaborative media annotation software;

  body: "### The 2020 Global Misinfodemic Report examines the impact of COVID-19 outside
    of the Global North\n\nMeedan is pleased to announce the 2020 Global Misinfodemic
    Report, a multidisciplinary, transnational collaboration of information scholars,
    legal experts, journalists and fact-checkers, focused on examining the impacts
    of COVID-19 misinformation in Kenya, South Korea, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Brazil
    and other regions. Working with scholars, verification experts and journalists
    from major academic institutions, broadcasting stations and fact-checking organizations,
    the Global Misinfodemic Report is an investigation into the way this unprecedented
    viral event is both reforming and confirming the state of our global information
    ecosystem. \n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, as countries worked to contain the
    first signs of the physical virus spreading, a secondary crisis occured: misinformation
    on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp contributed to [confusion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/coronavirus-avoid-sharing-social-media-disinformation-1.5497000),
    [panic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F),
    and sometimes real world physical health outcomes, including [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530).
    \n\nIn a recent [video broadcast](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity),
    UN Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged “This is a time for science
    and solidarity. Yet the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading. Harmful health advice
    and snake-oil solutions are proliferating. Falsehoods are filling the airwaves.
    Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet. Hatred is going viral, stigmatizing
    and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against this disease, too.”\n\nA
    misinfodemic is a term coined by Meedan researchers in [the Atlantic in 2018](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/),
    and it is defined as a phenomenon that takes place when online misinformation
    leads to the spread of disease. The COVID-19 misinfodemic will complicate our
    interactions with our neighbours and our own bodies long after a treatment is
    approved or a vaccine is developed for the physical disease. \n\nThe report touches
    on these key questions:\n\n- What types of COVID-19 misinformation are spreading
    online, and by whom?\n- Why is COVID-19 misinformation resonating with certain
    communities? \n- What are the varying impacts of that misinformation on  public
    health outcomes in different parts of the world, especially emerging economies?\n-
    What digital governance and policy issues are raised by COVID-19?\n\nThe first
    wave of the pandemic is beginning to settle in large parts of the developed world,
    but in emerging economies, the crisis may be just beginning. As the New York Times
    editorial board noted on April 13, 2020: \n\n“What probably lies ahead is the
    spread of the coronavirus through countries ravaged by conflict, through packed
    refugee camps and detention centers in places like Syria or Bangladesh, through
    teeming cities like Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro or Monrovia, where social distancing
    is impossible and government is not trusted, through countries without the fiscal
    capacity or health services to mount a viable response.\n\nThat would be disastrous
    not only for them but also for the rest of the world as supplies of raw materials
    are disrupted, fragile economies collapse, strongmen grow stronger and the virus
    doubles back to reinfect northern regions.”\n\nWhat is also likely to ensue, long
    after countries in North America and Europe control their initial outbreaks, is
    sustained low-quality and sometimes dangerous information about the pandemic.
    In Meedan’s own analyses of more than 5,700 submissions to our partners’ fact-checking
    tiplines between January 1 and April 8, 2020, we watched COVID-19 misinformation
    evolve in online spaces, including:\n\n- Unproven treatments involving tea, vitamins,
    hot water, heat, and hydroxychloroquine \n- Misinformation about penalties for
    spreading misinformation or just spreading information, about the pandemic \n-
    Xenophobia about different ethnic groups \n\nAll of this misinformation can trigger
    real-world health outcomes. Some countries are experiencing the most obvious and
    harmful manifestations of right now, such as in Iran, where [people are dying
    from drinking Methanol after false and misleading information circulated on social
    media about its use as a treatment](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/nearly-500-people-dead-in-iran-after-drinking-methanol-to-fight-off-covid-19-1.4870674).
    In other regions, the misinfodemic materializes as public trust in leadership
    weans and citizens look to sometimes misguided informal leaders for answers to
    complex scientific information. \n\nAs both the physical and online virus rages
    on into the summer, the Global Misinfodemic Report will begin publishing groups
    of articles from contributors around the world. Look back here or [sign up for
    our newsletter](https://meedan.com/checklist) for updates on when to expect the
    first batch of articles. "

  body: "We were thrilled to hear that the focus of Tech & Check this year would be
    on projects matching speakers’ claims with previously published fact-checks and
    other related text and image matching efforts in service of fact-checking. Just
    as we didn’t anticipate that our main technical focus would be the subject of
    this year’s gathering, we didn’t suspect that our respective planned travel from
    the UK and Brazil for this year’s Tech & Check would be replaced with an opening
    night mixer via Zoom due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 crisis around
    the world. Regardless of the global pandemic, on April 3rd, journalists, engineers,
    computer scientists and other professionals met virtually to watch a few demos
    and discuss claim matching in the context of fact-checking.\n\nLast year at [Tech
    & Check](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/tech-check-cooperative-2019/), we presented
    [Check Message](https://meedan.com/check), an integration between Check (Meedan’s
    open source platform for collaborative fact-checking) and the [WhatsApp Business
    API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api), as a tool to deal with misinformation
    in closed message applications at scale. Just a few days after our presentation,
    the technology went live with [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), an
    effort to monitor, verify, and conduct research on WhatsApp misinformation during
    the 2019 Indian Election led by Delhi-based media research and training organization
    [PROTO](https://www.pro.to/) and commissioned and technically assisted by WhatsApp.
    Check Message allows media partners to operate tip lines to which people can forward
    possibly misleading, miscontextualised, or false information they see to the partner
    for fact-checking. During the Indian Elections, PROTO received over 100,000 submissions
    from the public.\n\n![Caio Almeida presenting at Tech & Check 2019 in Duke University.

    Huth.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4B2OKx6sL10bVZHj87I38t/8d09acce21eec3d68322d26242b64dd7/Tech___Check_2019.jpg)\n<p

    and Democracy, and photo by Colin Huth.</p>\n\n\nMany of those submissions were
    similar to other submissions, but at that time we just had the technology implemented
    to match identical submissions—text or images—so, many submissions that were similar
    but not identical had to be manually marked as such, which was uselessly costly.
    In order to optimize that process, we started to work on tools that could suggest
    similar items automatically to our users.\n \nWe were honored to be one of five
    organizations that demonstrated their work in this area. In our case, we demonstrated
    our current claim and image matching tools for fact-checkers, which integrate
    with our open-source software, Check. We developed an [open-source architecture](https://github.com/meedan/alegre)
    to use ElasticSearch to efficiently search language volumes of text items by their
    vector representations in near real-time and integrated this into Check. For Checkpoint,
    we used pre trained word vectors, but the architecture we developed is not specific
    to these choices and can easily be adapted to other vector-representation models
    and languages. We are now using the [Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04307),
    and are working to develop additional approaches to support even more of many
    languages our partners across the world use. For images, we are using perceptual
    hashing and evaluating newer approaches including [PDQ](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/master/hashing/pdq).\n
    \n![Architectural diagram of Check’s open source claim similarity framework](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/gOQBQqGPrtCPCbFHRm1Wy/710c99128eb87060be2846b0af5a8718/check-similarity-bot.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Architectural diagram of Check’s <a href=\"https://github.com/meedan/check\">open
    source</a> claim similarity framework</p>\n\n \nFor both images and text, Check
    users are able to define a set of similarity rules, which can relate items to
    be verified based on how similar they are. The user defines that minimum similarity
    threshold, which is a number between 0% and 100%, and if our image and text matching
    tool returns a similarity value equal or higher than that threshold, two items
    are related automatically. The idea is that we are able to optimize the fact-checking
    process by group similar items together rather than working on them separately.
    This also helps our partners better understand what content is most submitted
    to their tip lines. The video below demonstrates those features.\n\n<p class=\"u-responsive-ratio\">\n<iframe
    class=\"youtube\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTbTQGhPpu0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"
    allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Video-demonstration
    of Check similarity tools, presented at Tech & Check 2020</p>\n\n\nThis was part
    of the discussion that followed the demos. In the afternoon, people interested
    and working on claim matching discussed the problem types we have ahead of us,
    and came up with three main branches: \n \nThe first one was obviously __claim
    matching and semantic text similarity__: the matching of a novel claim with previously
    checked claims to determine if there is a substantially similar previous claim.
    Potential solutions that were proposed include, for example, named entity overlap,
    vector representations, comparing with knowledge bases; categorization of previously
    made claims and comparison to a novel claim; and combinations of multiple approaches.
    \n \nThe second problem type was __human matching__. Pure computational fact checking
    is prone to mismatches, sometimes funny, sometimes truly detrimental. Where and
    how can human editors, crowdsourcing and other forms of human intervention be
    used to assist and mediate this system? One proposal for that is to have an editor
    as a final step in an otherwise computational pipeline. At Meedan, we’re trying
    to develop efficient human-in-the-loop approaches where we can finetune and improve
    our computational tools based on the standard actions users take while using Check.
    Every time users remove an automated match or add a manually match we gain valuable
    insights into the types of things that should and shouldn’t match. Over time,
    we want to use this data to evaluate new approaches and improve the existing approaches.
    In other words, we see the system more as a circle than a pipeline: our algorithms
    make suggestions and learn from users’ actions. \n \nThe third problem type we
    discussed was __image matching__, and we discussed solutions like different image
    hashing algorithms, object retrieval, object identification and information extraction
    from images.\n \nWe are excited to keep working on those problems and to contribute
    with the Tech & Check community, and we can’t wait to share more interesting insights
    and findings next year at Tech & Check."

  body: "With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching Latin America and the rest of the world,
    we are living through unprecedented times in our civilization. Social distancing
    is the norm for those who are privileged enough to have shelter; sheltering-in-place
    is the norm for those with enough flexible income to keep food in storage for
    two weeks;  and washing hands regularly for 20 seconds is the norm when you have
    water to run for that long and that often. In Latin America and other emerging
    economies where most of the population live in [urban dense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html)
    areas the outcome of this disease is daunting. \n\nThis can also be a time to
    remember the power we have in gathering as a community to collaborate and create
    new and inclusive pathways. The following article is a collection of thoughts
    as a speaker and as an observant participant in the #VoicesOnTheRise Mediathon
    in México, which occurred November 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\n> \"Para
    cambiar los medios necessitamos cambiarlo nosotras (to change the media we will
    need to change it ourselves)\" said Mariana Santos, founder and CEO of Chicas
    Poderosas, at the beginning of the 2019 Mediathon in Mexico. This speech set the
    tone for the rest of the weekend, and it sums up Chicas Poderosas an all-female
    digital media professinals network and Meedan partner. \n\nIn a historic building
    at the center of Mexico City, 100 women from 17 Mexican states got together for
    two days with the goal of creating multimedia projects on subjects relevant to
    their context and based on the current sexual assaults occurring in the country.
    \n\nTo get to this meeting spot you would have to first find yourself on a street
    right behind the Catedral Metropolitana, a catholic church that is part of a series
    of buildings that stand today on top of what used to be The Templo Mayor, the
    heart of the Mexica empire.\n\nAs the event started, the women took pictures first
    of the stage and the speakers, but slowly as they started to chat with each other
    during the activities of the day, selfies emerged— a prelude to the professional
    relationships and friendships that were forged at these events. Despite the grey
    building, colors were abundant in Chicas banners, participant's hairs, [pañuelos](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2019/06/08/color-por-color-que-significan-los-24-panuelos-que-se-venden-en-las-calles-portenas/)
    and children's toys. \n\n\nA little girl was running between the participants'
    tables, and was covering the event by taking pictures with her mother's camera.
    A future journalist? No way to tell, but she was embraced and taken care of by
    the community. In Latin America there is an increasing number of women self identifying
    as [household heads](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/unequal-family-lives/families-in-latin-america/27F2E01B797AD1489A238BFDF2075F1C/core-reader),
    and as they become mothers the participation in professional events declines,
    as do career development opportunities. This effect is known as the [baby penalty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813
    \"Baby Penalty\"). The presence of kids in this event set a precedent for Chicas,
    and in 2020 all Mediathons will make clear in their calls to the community that
    mothers and children are welcome *(due to COVID-19 pandemic Mediathons will be
    held online)*. \n \nThe words used during most of the interactions were those
    of a call for action, pure energy, and resistance. Chicas Mediathons are feminist
    spaces, and platforms used to capacitate and share knowledge. The crowd was composed
    of psychologists, philosophers, photographers, developers, designers, and journalists.
    All the presenters were women, and they engaged a crowd  of diverse personalities:
    a few raised their voices to be heard, others nodded.\n\n### The Mediathon Model:
    Building a community by building safe spaces\n\nTo ensure that the room was transformed
    into a safe space, [rules of behavior ](http://chicaspoderosas.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Co%CC%81digo-Chicas-ES.pdf
    \"Chicas Code of conduct\")and engagement were shared as soon as the event began.
    Chicas defines a safe a place as one that is free of social, cultural, racial
    and sexual oppression. The material with the code of conduct was sent to the participants
    beforehand, and they were reminded by the organizers that they were always available
    to answer any questions and to help if something that violated the code or made
    them feel uncomfortable happened. A few members were defined as the go-to people
    for any woman that felt the code was violated. There were only a few men present,
    of those, most were working at the catering service and only a couple representing
    NGOs that were speaking on the first day. \n\nMediathons are made real thanks
    to Chicas volunteer ambassadors in each country/city in which they run an event.
    The team organizing it was composed of members that first started by attending
    or presenting at one of Chicas Poderosas events around Latin America, which is
    a common way to get to know and be a part of the community. In this case, most
    of them were not from México City and had instead traveled from distant provinces.
    \n\nThe event was based on a two-day structure centered around a contextualized
    issue, in this case, violence against women in México. The first segment involved
    local NGOs and communities presenting their work on gender violence, violence
    against women journalists, abortion and reproductive rights. After that, the participants
    decided which subtopic they wanted to investigate further, and teams formed around
    the multimedia projects. On the second day,  women leaders in their field presented
    issues on which they are experts, such as online engagement, online security,
    and fact-checking tools (this last one was presented by a zombie-like me while
    I was fighting a mix of: flu and CDMX dry climate). After this, they worked on
    the projects with their mentors and at the end presented their multimedia projects
    and timelines.\n\nThe highlight of this experience was when one of the participants
    started presenting her project in a Mayan language. The entire crowd clapped,
    shouted and, safe to say, I had goosebumps. Coming from Brazil, a country that
    systematically erased (and still does) the existence of the indigenous population,
    it was humbling to hear that ancient and important language. That woman speaking
    summed to me what Chicas is about: sharing and saving space for underrepresented
    voices that shape our communities. \n\n### One-month mentoring projects\n\nThe
    projects presented were about a myriad of subjects: abortion, sexuality, a radio
    community directed to indigenous women focusing on fighting gender violence in
    6 different local languages, child and teenage pregnancies, masculinity and gender
    roles. \n\n[Here](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/historias-que-ponen-nuestras-vocesenalza-ad1b31907010)

    at these photos now, it’s hard to remember when it was possible to come together
    in such a large group. Adapting to the COVID-19 reality Chicas Poderosas is working
    on an online format for the mediathon and exploring new ways to innovate, sustain
    and expand their community using digital tools. This year one of the initiatives
    we will be supporting Chicas is the [Conversaciones Poderosas en La Pandemia COVID-19](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/conversacionespoderosas-en-la-pandemia-de-covid-19-71daa8ea523f
    \"Conversaciones Poderosas\"), a space to talk about the various challenges that
    the pandemic presents on a professional and personal level for journalists, share
    ideas on how to face them and exchange points of view from different countries.
    The objective is to create a space of containment, learning and accompaniment
    for the community."

  body: "The bot, which also works on other social messaging platforms, is designed
    to scale response through the COVID crisis and other topical content.\n\nMeedan
    is pleased to roll out Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
    and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
    Twitter DM, and more. Now being tested in Brazil, India and across Africa with
    COVID-19 content, our bot is an extension of [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
    our collaborative platform for digital media verification and annotation, to boost
    the work of human journalists through AI-powered claims matching, smart menus,
    and the ability to source new content directly from users for fact-checking.\n\nIt
    has the following key features:\n\n- A fully customizable interaction scenario
    , allowing fact-checking teams to spin up interactive menus of frequently-requested
    content to react to events rapidly  \n- Enables audience-submitted tips for queries
    not answered by the bot\n- Ties directly to a team’s Check database, allowing
    them to send previously fact-checked reports\n\nFor our partner organizations,
    the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, size the
    demand for specific topics, and distribute key information in close messaging
    networks. Through building this relations, it is also the  opportunity to develop
    interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end-users to assess behavioural
    impacts of fact-checks.\n\n![phone bot](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/417goq4WmR29NxllRAvdDX/11677981cda6d5de9658ddfc6dc2dc9b/phone_bot.gif)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Check Bot: a fully customizable bot designed for fact-checkers
    and journalists to run fact-checking tiplines on Whatsapp, Facebook messenger,
    Twitter DM, and more.</p>\n\nWhen designing this bot, we worked with our fact-checking
    partners to ensure the following principles were met:\n\n- __Audience development:__
    Fact-checking teams have spent years cultivating trust with their audiences, and
    we wanted to make sure the bot supports this work. Teams can customize every interaction
    and content  that represents their unique voice. They can  continue to receive
    fact-check requests through the same tipline and communicate with their audiences
    directly.\n- __Ready for scale:__ We are testing the bot with teams that receive
    thousands of messages per week. The bot is designed to handle requests of many
    thousands more, automating frequently-requested content while overall improving
    the quality of tipline content submissions.\n- __Local content, local languages:__
    This bot can provide more detailed content coverage for local audiences that complements
    the work of global health organizations and national health ministries. Fact-checking
    organizations can create custom resource responses for their end users that are
    context or language-specific, directly meeting a target population’s health information
    needs. Thanks to our partnership with the [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/),
    we can also localize the content and interface to relevant languages.\n\nRight
    now, we’re testing this bot with COVID-19 content and localized COVID-19 resources.
    Per our ongoing commitments to open source and the [Open COVID Pledge](https://meedan.com/blog/meedan-supports-the-open-covid-pledge/),
    it is also [open source](https://github.com/meedan/check). The goal is to link
    this up with [Meedan’s COVID-19 Expert Database](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/),
    developed by our [Digital Health Lab](https://health.meedan.com/). This database
    contains contextualized health information developed and vetted by public health
    experts that can be used as source material in fact-checks, removing some of the
    challenges of accessing verified expert content  \n\nThe bot can be fully adapted
    for any kind of content, addressing audience queries related to politics, science
    and breaking news events. We are planning to add more messaging services such
    as Lime, Telegram, Viber, Instagram and many more. \n\nInterested in a demo? Get
    in touch at <a href=\"mailto:hello@meedan.com\">hello@meedan.com</a>.\n"

  body: "This past Wednesday, three Meedanis had a chance to attend The Reboot’s Masterclass
    on “[Designing Collaborations for Urgent, Courageous Change](https://reboot.org/2020/04/14/driving-transformative-collaboration-reboot-masterclass-series/),”
    a 1.5-hour session on cross-sector collaboration. We will be sharing our team's
    insights for the other two sessions of this webinar series. \n\nAs the workshop
    describes itself:\n\n> COVID-19 demands that we build diverse coalitions to advance
    equitable and effective response efforts. These efforts must draw on the radical
    imaginations of our artists, the moral courage of our activists, the innovation
    of community organizers, the agenda-setting influence of our media, the values
    of our civil society leaders, the infrastructure of the private sector, and the
    reach of our public institutions.\n\nAt Meedan, we work at the intersection of
    a number of different sectors — journalists, academics, policy researchers, human
    rights workers, artists and others — at a global scale, and so this is a topic
    close to our heart. Here are three things we learned from speakers [Panthea Lee,
    Founder and Executive Director of The Reboot](https://reboot.org/team/panthea-lee/)
    and [Chelsey Lepage, Associate Director of Programs](https://reboot.org/team/chelsey-lepage/):\n\n__Program
    and initiative design can look like agile product development, starting with the
    problem and people.__\n\nFocus on the problem first, invite fewer subject matter
    experts to the table and more the people that need the solution. Chelsey Lepage
    suggested framing the problem as a hunch to make everyone collaborating more comfortable
    when giving inputs. It was insightful to see design and product development concepts
    applied to program work in such a clear manner.\n\nIn agile product development,
    defining a good problem statement is always a challenge, and if it is not well-crafted,
    the user need (solution) will be unmet. Making sure the team and users are involved
    in the framing is the key. Otherwise, all those hours spent on meetings, coding
    and design will have resulted in something —  in this context, an initiative —
    that will never be used. \n\nDuring the webinar, other concepts drew on that shared
    parallel such as “success criteria''. Knowing what criteria must be met so it
    is considered a success and how you will measure and identify it is also a core
    part of the product development cycle. They are embedded in the user stories,
    so every feature built brings value and is solving a user need. In program design
    this was presented in the same way: how will you know that an objective in your
    program was met? What will success look like? The Reboot’s webinar made clear
    that such as it is in product development, a fruitful initiative design is impossible
    without true collaboration.\n\n— *Isabella Barroso, Program Manager, Latin America*\n\n__When
    developing a collaboration, work on building relationships before focusing on
    the technical challenges you hope to address together.__\n\nWhen launching or
    developing a collaboration, the webinar leads emphasized the importance of thinking
    about collaborations as ongoing journeys, with interpersonal relationships to
    develop and strengthen before technical challenges become the focus. Presenters
    emphasized that this happens with multiple touchpoints to strengthen the collaboration,
    to build social cohesion, and to have “conversations as humans first, and as representatives
    of an organization second”. As organizations work to develop strong and long-term
    collaborations, the webinar emphasized that relationship building early on can
    help strengthen the interpersonal accountability that can help with achieving
    success as a team. \n\nOver the last decade, Meedan has prioritized the development
    of a global community of contributors and collaborators, working together to build
    impactful projects at the intersection of information equity and accessibility,
    global journalism and digital literacy. This webinar emphasized an important value
    that we as an organization hold dear: as we continue to develop collaborations
    to address the pressing global challenges of today, we’re committed to centralizing
    the focus on all forms of expertise, ensuring that all stakeholders are part of
    collaboration design, and strengthening the foundational relationships that enable
    success and maximize the impact we can realize together. \n\n— *Nat Gyenes, Senior
    Program Manager and Lead, Digital Health Lab*\n\n__Living Expertise is a valuable
    form of expertise that’s often overlooked in favor of formal training and education.__\n\nThe
    webinar discussed the concept of Living Experts, defined as those who “understand
    the lived experience of a problem or context.” These experts sit alongside a diversity
    of perspectives in cross-sector collaboration, such as technical experts, decision
    makers, implementers and allies. “Take an expensive view of ‘expertise’,” noted
    the webinar leaders. At Check Global and in [Meedan programs](https://meedan.com/projects)
    overall, we aim to center different forms of expertise, and this framework made
    a lot of sense for how we try to implement our initiatives.\n\n— *Mina Xiao, Operations*"

  body: "As global journalism grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of challenges
    to press freedom remain. But the crisis also presents an opportunity to reimagine
    media in a post COVID-19 world. In time with World Press Fredom Day, we are launching
    our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/),
    our community for non-profits and collectives working in the area of independent
    media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) in emerging economies.\n\nWith
    our mission to support global journalism, Meedan cares deeply about press freedom
    around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenges we’ve been
    monitoring and writing about through our [Checklist](https://meedan.com/checklist)
    newsletter. Some of the trends we’ve seen are deeply concerning:\n\n### Journalists
    are on the frontlines of the pandemic\nJournalists have been on the frontlines
    reporting the pandemic in different regions. Reporters have been going to hospitals
    and other hotspots where the risk of exposure to the virus and infection is very
    high. Several media outlets do not have or cannot provide proper personal protective
    equipment (PPE) for their staff. According to the [Committee for the Protection
    of Journalists (CPJ), there is risk of the pandemic impacting journalists’ physical
    health and psychological well-being](https://cpj.org/blog/2020/04/qa-us-photographers-navigate-a-new-reality-under-c.php).
    \ \n\n### Media jobs are facing historic losses\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not
    only exposed media workers to physical vulnerabilities, it has also decimated
    an already battered media sector, with many companies reducing hours, holding
    back salaries or simply sacking their media staff outright, according to the [South
    Asia Press Freedom Report](https://samsn.ifj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/States-of-Control-IFJ-SAPFR-2019-20.pdf).
    Shrinking revenue from advertisements, serious disruptions in circulation of newspapers
    and printed publications and a severe strain on limited revenues have resulted
    in a job crisis where reporters and journalists across the world are [experiencing
    pay cuts, reduced hiring and layoffs](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/here-are-the-newsroom-layoffs-furloughs-and-closures-caused-by-the-coronavirus/).
    \ \n\n### Democracies are undermining press freedom\n[Over the last two and a
    half months, the International Press Institute’s (IPI) COVID-19 tracker has documented
    a total of 162 different press freedom violations related to the coronavirus](https://ipi.media/covid19-media-freedom-monitoring/).
    These range from verbal or physical attacks on journalists to arrests, restrictions
    on access to information and media censorship. This has created a hostile and
    challenging environment for independent media and press freedom. Several agencies
    also note that the current pandemic has given states an opportunity to exercise
    greater control over the media. IPI has also documented 16 cases of ‘fake news’
    laws either being passed with disproportionate penalties or used to take down
    content about the virus online. IPI notes that while some of these laws are sincere
    but ill-conceived, others appear to deliberately strengthen authoritarian regimes’
    arsenal against the press.\n \n### Local journalism is under threat\nDuring a
    pandemic, people need timely, reliable and unbiased news on local conditions,
    however, the absence of sustainable and robust business models and distribution
    networks for local news is making that increasingly difficult. [These newsrooms
    will have to make strategic shifts in their business models in order to survive
    the pandemic](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/how-local-news-can-survive-and-thrive-during-the-pandemic/).
    \n\n### Journalists grapple with misinformation during a pandemic\nIn times of
    a global pandemic, access to accurate and unbiased information about the disease
    becomes ever more important. It is critical for the media to share verified and
    reliable information. However, the widespread use of social media and other platforms
    to share unverified information, often without scientific proof, can be dangerous
    and life threatening in the current situation. [UN chief António Guterres noted](https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/time-science-and-solidarity)
    that \"the global ‘misinfo-demic’ is spreading,\" using a word coined by Meedan
    researchers.  [UNESCO is promoting two social media campaigns “to fight the infodemic
    of rumours and disinformation”](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373354_eng.locale=en).
    UNESCO has also created a COVID- 19 resource centre for media. This online platform
    aims to help journalists track false information regarding the pandemic and report
    on the crisis reliably and effectively, as encouraged by the theme of World Press
    Freedom Day 2020, “journalism without fear or favour”.\n\nAt the same time, as
    [Meedan board member Maria Ressa wrote recently](https://time.com/5820620/maria-ressa-coronavirus-democracy/),
    “The mission of independent journalism has never been as important as it is today,
    when decisions are being made without transparency. Now more than ever, facts
    matter. Truth matters. Checks and balances matter.” It’s vital that those working
    for media freedom around the world come together to re-envision what this can
    look like.\n\nIn time with World Press Freedom Day, Meedan is thrilled to launch
    our [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
    The network is Meedan’s community that brings together non-profits and collectives
    working in the area of independent media and information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific (APAC), East Africa, Latin America
    (LATAM), and the North Africa Western Asia region (NAWA).\n\nOur partners from
    different regions will participate in the launch of the Check Global Network this
    week. The network will provide its members access to opportunities and forums
    for sharing, learning and reflection. The main activities will focus on capacity
    building of members on journalism, fact-checking and organizational development,
    providing them access to digital tools and the opportunity to be part of a growing
    impactful community."

  body: |-
    "I'm going to the grocery store asap," my friend texted me a few weeks ago, at the peak of the confusion around COVID-19 in the US. He'd heard word from a friend of a friend that President Trump was going to declare a nationwide quarantine. The text came through with urgency and authority --- the President was going to invoke the Stafford Act, the National Guard was going to be called in, and no one would be allowed outside their homes for two weeks.

    It wasn't true, but it felt true, and it felt especially true in the early morning hours when I got the message. I could feel in my bones a sense of dread --- wait, maybe this time it's real? California and New York were already shutting down. President Trump did declare a national emergency using the Stafford Act. There were indeed [credible recommendations from epidemiologists](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-13/coronavirus-shopping-list-your-essential-quarantine-items) that we stock up for two weeks in case we need to quarantine. And the [National Guard had already been called](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814164923/new-york-state-deploys-national-guard-to-manage-coronavirus-in-nyc-suburb) into a number of outbreak zones in the United States.

    The problem comes in the shades of gray: the Stafford Act does grant enormous powers to the President, but [national quarantine is not one of them](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/19/fact-check-does-stafford-act-allow-trump-order-quarantine/2872743001/). The National Guard has been deployed, not to enforce anything remotely resembling martial law but instead to help with [cleaning, testing and food delivery](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/24/21188088/coronavirus-national-guard-testing-food-cleaning-martial). Cities and states have indeed issued shelter-in-place orders, but [the federal government doesn't have direct power](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/825293201/a-president-is-not-able-to-order-a-national-quarantine-experts-say) over these. Around the world, we're indeed  seeing national lockdowns in places like India, China and Hungary, with tremendous implications on civil rights. In this context, it might not be unreasonable to think that a military-enforced quarantine might be coming for the United States.

    [A recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-text-messages-national-quarantine.html) pointed out that false and misleading information is part of an ongoing problem in the wake of the pandemic: "With the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the world, misinformation has followed suit," the article noted. It continues:

    Other [SMS] messages in recent weeks, reflecting the same pattern, have warned that New York City public transit would shut down last week (it's still running), or that the entire Pacific Northwest would be quarantined last week (also not true). At least one message said that President Trump would declare a national emergency within three days --- Mr. Trump declared the emergency on Friday, but that did not give him the power to impose a national quarantine.

    ![Meedan sms 2](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/Qad98m6x2PoDGg9WD0DaW/91f2f80e2539ad70eec5389dd59470c6/Meedan_sms_2.png)

    Over the past year, the misinformation research community has been sounding the alarm about deepfakes, [a form of synthetic media](https://lab.witness.org/projects/synthetic-media-and-deep-fakes/) (i.e., media made by artificial intelligence) wherein people are made to look like they're saying or doing something that they're not. In January of this year, as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was spreading across China and --- as we would later learn --- much of the world, [Facebook announced a ban on AI-generated videos](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/07/facebook-bans-deepfake-videos-in-run-up-to-us-election). That same month, [William A. Galston at the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/is-seeing-still-believing-the-deepfake-challenge-to-truth-in-politics/) warned that "If AI is reaching the point where it will be virtually impossible to detect audio and video representations of people saying things they never said (and even doing things they never did), seeing will no longer be believing, and we will have to decide for ourselves---without reliable evidence---whom or what to believe."

    Galston wrote these words with an eye on the upcoming 2020 election in the US, but just a few months later, the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly placed the US election into the background of national conversations. Furthermore, the misinformation thriving now is not deepfakes but cheap fakes --- what [Data & Society researchers Britt Paris and Joan Donovan](https://datasociety.net/library/deepfakes-and-cheap-fakes/) define as "an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing." Cheap fakes can simply be miscontextualized videos, like one going viral on [WhatsApp purportedly showing panicked mobs in the Netherlands](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/03/13/monitoring-and-debunking-covid-19-panic-the-haarlem-aldi-hoax/). 

    But much of today's pandemic misinformation is proving to be even simpler: what I call text fakes --- the oldest form of media manipulation, made possible by the ability to put words on a page, or a screen, or spread it around rapidly on private messaging apps. 

    The text fake goes back to the days of scrolls and pamphlets. [The ancient Romans engaged in information combat](https://www.ft.com/content/aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6), using the literary implements of their time to spread disinformation and confusion. But it was the rise of moveable type in the 15th century that soon yielded pamphleteering as a popular medium for politics. As such, they became an early source of text fakes: "Cheap and made on the smallest sheets of paper," noted [one article in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-we-solved-fake-news-the-first-time), "pamphlets were written for attention and money. How do you get attention? Then, as now, successful strategies included exaggeration and hating others (in the pamphlets' case, Catholics). Elaborate conspiracy theories were popular, too." Essayist and pamphleteer Jonathan Swift famously observed that "falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after." 

    Much of the deepfake discussion in 2019 focused lagely on the content of synthetic media --- what the media shows, how to detect it, what it might say, how it might mislead. Cheap fakes and text fakes floating around private messaging apps and public social media are, alternatively, a reminder of the importance of the context of media --- the mental state of the recipient, the narrative discourse in media and the general public, the relationship between the person sending the message and the person(s) receiving it, the political situation in the region, and a variety of other factors that influence how we interpret a piece of content, whether it's a piece of text or a fully-manipulated video.

    The history of writing suggests that as more people gain access to writing tools and the ability to manipulate the written word, the more we see misinformation in text. We should expect the same of video, with the rise of video editing tools and synthetic media. Beware the text fake --- it's a powerful reminder that when content flies around the internet, our understanding of its context still comes limping after.

  title: 'Elections, Promises, and COVID-19 : Three Years of Supporting Fact-Checking
    and Verification in East Africa'
  slug: elections-promises-and-covid-19-three-years-in-supporting-fact-checking-and
  body: "In July 2018, I traveled to Zimbabwe to join The Carter Center to work with
    civil society organizations and newsrooms on tracking and addressing misinformation
    around the first harmonized elections in the country after Robert Mugabe stepped
    down.\n\nWhen I arrived in Zimbabwe, election-related propaganda was all over
    news media and social media. As an Egyptian, I was all too familiar with this
    kind of information ecosystem: mainstream media is owned by the state, and its
    goal is simply to amplify and spread one side of the story — that of those in
    power. Wandering the streets of Harare, it was impossible not to notice the dominance
    of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ([Zanu-PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU%E2%80%93PF))
    in its use of posters and billboards. Zimbabwe’s digital streets — Facebook, Twitter,
    YouTube, were similarly flooded with pro-Zanu-PF content: memes, articles, and
    videos all designed and spread to support the long-time ruling party.\n\nThough
    we had worked for more than a decade in North Africa, at the time our work in
    sub-saharan Africa was in its early days. Meedan was in the middle of developing
    a network in East Africa, which included launching a partnership with [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/)
    to support the fact-checking ecosystem in the region. Fact-checkers at PesaCheck
    integrated Meedan’s open source toolkit, [Check](http://meedan.com/en/check),
    into their workflows and verified statements from public figures in Kenya, Uganda
    and Tanzania. \n\nComing to Zimbabwe in 2018, we found a nation and people full
    of hope and looking for the political change needed to address decades of corruption
    and the challenges of [their brutal economic situation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview).
    In an earlier [post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
    this year, I wrote about how Robert Mugabe’s retirement from his presidency in
    2017 opened up the region to a new era. Our invitation to join the Carter Center
    team in Zimbabwe to help partners monitor and assess the role of online mis and
    disinformation represented [the first time in more than a decade that international
    election observers](https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/commonwealth/africa/zimbabwe/zimbabwe-and-election-observation-missions/)
    were able to monitor an election in Zimbabwe, and as such certainly represented
    the first online election media analysis effort there. . In this spirit the 2018
    Zimbabwe presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections (harmonized
    elections) took place on July 30, 2018.\n\n[Our collaborations in Zimbabwe](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/how-zimbabwes-fact-checkers-monitored-the-2018-election-using-check-51c948d5d7f6)
    included the fact-checking initiative [ZimFact](https://zimfact.org/) as well
    as the Centre for Innovation & Technology ([CITE](http://www.cite.org.zw/about-us/)),
    a group in South Zimbabwe that supports initiatives led by youths, journalists,
    and designers. \n\n\n### A new phase of Check Global: Post-Election Narratives\n\nThe
    Kenya elections in 2017 were “marred by serious human rights violations, including
    unlawful killings and beatings by police during protests and house-to-house operations”
    according to[ Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/27/kenya-post-election-killings-abuse).
    Under those circumstances, Check Global fact-checking partners CITE (in Zimbabwe)
    \ and PesaCheck  (in Kenya) continued to verify social media evidence after the
    elections and focused on how to hold politicians accountable to their constituencies.\n\nCurrently,
    PesaCheck in Kenya is building a prototype of Wajibisha, which means “to hold
    accountable,” a promise tracker with a focus on fact-checking budgetary promises
    and election promises, for initial deployment in Kenya and Uganda. Promises are
    logged on Meedan 's Check platform covering the following thematic areas - Health,
    Housing, Jobs, Governance, Environment, Traffic Management and Social Inclusion
    (Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities). Updates on the progress of delivery
    on these promises will then reflect on the main promise tracker website, which
    is not yet available to the general public but will be soon.\n\nEric Mugendi,
    the managing editor of PesaCheck, explains their use of Check:: \n\n> \"Check
    as a platform has enabled us to collaborate both within and outside our organization
    to fact-check and verify content. Our team is distributed in three countries,
    and we work on different platforms. Check allows us to keep track of what everyone
    is doing, and ensures that our work is done to the same standard. We are exploring
    new ways to use the platform, and the most promising one so far is in keeping
    track of promises by elected figures. \"\n\nIn Zimbabwe, CITE is working on [The
    Digital Media for Accountability Project](https://www.cite.org.zw/category/factcheckzw/).
    This is an innovative project that combines digital technology, journalistic fact-checking
    skills and capacity building to promote social accountability at the local government
    level. Focusing mainly on Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second capital city, the project
    aims to track and check statements made by the Bulawayo City Council. CITE continues
    to use Check in their daily fact-checking workflow to provide citizens with timely,
    relevant and accurate information on issues of local governance, service delivery
    and public resources management. \n\nCalling Check’s workflow “harmonious” and
    “intuitive,” Sean Ndlovu, co-founder of CITE, said: \n\n> \"The Check platform
    has allowed us at CITE to be able to follow up on announcements, promises and
    proclamations made by local authorities in Zimbabwe in a systematic and archival
    way. The Check platform also allows us to collaborate as a team by assigning tasks
    to each other in a seamless way thus helping the team to report on claims in a
    simple and standardised format. \"\n\n### Check Global intersections with different
    projects at Meedan\n\nWe’ve also expanded our work with our current Check Global
    partners in East Africa in that it  is also feeding the capacity of our Claims
    and Memes Database (CMDb) project. The CMDb project was possible by the generous
    support of Open Tech Fund (OTF), and it's an API-accessible repository of fact
    checked claims and debunked visual misinformation from internet repressive countries,
    where disinformation and social network manipulation have become key censorship
    strategies. As we witnessed visual misinformation travel between Kenya and Zimbabwe
    during the elections, we realized the importance of creating an annotated and
    verified database for claims and memes. \n\nIn July 2019, I was honored to travel
    to Kenya to participate in a collaborative pop-up newsroom to counter misinformation
    during the Kenyan census. This effort was organized by Meedan and supported by
    Article 19. During this pop-up workshop we collected, annotated, and verified
    Kenyan memes based on the census.\n\n### What's new for Check Global in East Africa
    in 2020?\n\nAs the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced the COVID-19 outbreak
    as a pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
    and a global health crisis, health misinformation and rumors have multiplied across
    platforms, thus undermining efforts for producing reliable and factual information
    around the virus.\n\nEast African countries face different challenges on many
    levels, not only in terms of weakened [public health services](https://time.com/5816299/coronavirus-africa-ventilators-doctors/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=world_&linkId=85995855)
    and infrastructure, but also rising [mis/disinformation on social media platforms](https://www.article19.org/resources/coronavirus-new-article-19-briefing-on-tackling-misinformation/),
    lacking [access to public records and information](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/why-access-to-information-on-covid-19-is-crucial-to-persons-with-disabilities-in-africa/),
    [severe cutbacks to free speech](https://ifex.org/covid-19-in-africa-right-to-information-another-casualty-with-spike-in-attacks-on-journalists/),
    [internet and telecom accessibility issues](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-internet-is-making-stay-at-home-difficult-for-africans/a-53048013),
    and worsening [civil rights violations](https://cipesa.org/2020/04/cipesa-submission-to-un-special-rapporteur-spotlights-rights-concerns-in-africas-covid-19-response/).\n\n__Meedan
    launched [new COVID-19 microgrants](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/)__
    to support independent media projects in Africa. Our goal was to support journalists,
    activists and citizen journalists to explore open source investigations and verification
    storytelling. \n\nWe are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely in East Africa
    with our partners, with whom we are discussing and adapting new ways of virtual
    training programs that, while it will no longer require the physical attendance
    of participants, will continue to keep them involved. \n\n[CITE](https://www.cite.org.zw/)
    just launched an online learning platform '[Funda](http://funda.cite.org.zw/)'
    (meaning 'learn' in [Ndebele](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ndebele-Zimbabwean-people)),
    relying on online learning resources from [Nawa Media](https://nawamedia.org/courses/),
    a separate Check Global project that brings together journalism students across
    five countries (Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) across North Africa,
    West Asia to instill the next generation of Arab-speaking journalists with open-source
    investigation tools, fact-checking skills, and an acumen for digital and media
    literacy. \n\nSeparately, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) is creating two
    massive open online courses (MOOC), one on general fact-checking processes using
    Check and another on how to build Promise Tracking using Check. PesaCheck will
    conduct virtual training using these modules with four different newsrooms in
    Kenya.\n\n\nThis increased inter-partner collaboration, not only manifested in
    East Africa, has accelerated and strengthened Meedan’s aspirations to bring our
    partners together within the [Check Global Network](https://meedan.com/blog/join-the-check-global-network-for-media-and-tech-in-emerging-economies/).
    The Network  virtually launched on May 5, 2020.. \n\n\n### Events\n\nIn light
    of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not attending events this year, as a number of
    the conferences we typically attend have been canceled. That said, we are moving
    this energy online and hosting  a series of online conversations. Please stay
    tuned for more info on these virtual events by following us on social media or
    on our newsletter. \n\nWe invite all our partners to send us tips and ideas for
    our weekly newsletter, [The Checklist](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=8fa4ab9399),
    weekly misinformation news around the world. Meedan's Digital Health Lab is working
    with a team of scientists to answer the most important and complex pandemic questions.
    Each week, we highlight [the most important questions](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=539fbe59ddc773c6592797bf2&id=70729b5123)
