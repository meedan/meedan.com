      in the Asia-Pacific region which received grants to cover the impact of the
      COVID-19 pandemic in their communities.
    long_description: "Seven grass-root media organizations from Cambodia, the Philippines,
      Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka were awarded Check Global's COVID-19 microgrants
      in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\nDuring the pandemic, vulnerable groups faced
      the risk of being cut off from vital information, especially crucial health
      information. The projects we supported in the region aimed at addressing this
      issue, and focusing on removing barriers to accessing media and technology.\n\nThese
      projects ranged from a [website to provide fact-checked content for the differently
      abled](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/),[ powerful imagery in social
      media](https://www.facebook.com/storiesofwomencampaign/) to highlight violence
      against women, [a digitial literacy campaign](https://basabali.org/) and [blogs
      capturing the stories of frontline workers](https://iyapsl.org/).\n\nOn November
      20, 2020, we are hosting an event bringing together the COVID-19 microgrant
      recipients and other [Check Global partners](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
      from the region to share their experiences and challenges of working amid a
      devastating pandemic and yet make a lasting impact in communities they work
      for. All participants will get the opportunity to speak about their work using
      different formats and this will be followed by an informal meet and greet session.
      Since this is a diverse group with varying projects, languages and time zones,
      the presentation formats are flexible. The aim is to have more voices, including
      team members and people from the community level, and enable collaborations
      across the region.\n\nIf you would like to know more about our APAC event, please

      on the stories of women leaders in underrepresented and marginalized communities

      media outlets ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and
      [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)) creating a tipline on WA and Telegram that
      increased regional awareness related to the pandemic and desinformation. \n\nAnother
      fact checking initiative, [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/), produced
      pieces focused on the favelas communities, indeginous population and LGBTQIA
      population in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com/) a group of
      Latin America women photographers, built their[ website](https://rudacolectiva.com/NO-ES-UNA-CADENA-PT)

      we supported the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.gdezza.net/)
      on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.\n\nOn November 24,
      we invited our COVID-19 grantees to a conversation facilitated by Lu Ortiz,
      from [Victa Activa, an initiative](http://vita-activa.org) which provides online
      support for women and LGBTIQ+ journalists, activists and gender, land and labor
      rights, and freedom of expression defenders. The event will be a closed virtual
      space for grantees to share their projects and challenges faced during the pandemic
      and its effects on their wellbeing. The idea is to strengthen the community
      by listening and sharing healing practices that are ancestral and decolonial.\\\n\nIf

    description: This is the closing event for four independent media pratcitioners
      and organizations in the NAWA region which received grants to cover the impact
      of the COVID-19 pandemic in their communities.
    long_description: "Four independent media workers and organizations operating
      in the NAWA region received funding to produce and sustain creative, necessary
      local journalistic work. \n\nThese initiatives have worked in  particularly
      challenging conditions, and the work they did ranged from the production of
      a digital health program through [a popular community radio station](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3175873192467573),
      to a [trilingual health fact-checking campaign](https://nawaat.org/) in Tunisia,
      an essential and important investigation on [the plight of African refugees
      in Tangier](https://www.lejournaldetanger.com/reportage-a-tanger-le-calvaire-pour-la-survie-des-migrants-subsahariens/)
      amidst the pandemic, and a painstaking three-part investigation documenting
      the [Syrian regime's inadequate health response to the pandemic](https://syriauntold.com/2020/08/04/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B6%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%A7/).\n\nOur
      grantees' experiences, therefore, provide a much needed teaching opportunity
      for aspiring and budding journalists in NAWA. We've opted, in that sense, to
      convene a closed panel on November 14th that would bring together the COVID-19
      microgrant NAWA grantees with our 25 journalism students participating in the
      [Check NAWA Newsroom](https://nawamedia.org/newsroom/). Our students, who have
      been receiving [training and mentorship](https://nawamedia.org/blog/2020/05/08/open-democracy-training-for-nawa-newsroom-students/)
      on investigative journalism and open-source skills, have also done the grueling
      job of creating active remote newsrooms in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.
      \n\nDespite their dedication, our students have been forced to reckon with the
      challenges brought by remote journalistic work such as lacking internet access,
      debilitating local events, and a pandemic. Through our event, students will
      get the opportunity to ask questions to the COVID-19 microgrant NAWA grantees
      while also learning about their diverse projects. \n\nIf you would like to know

    long_description: "Six grassroot African organizations from Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria,
      Somalia, Tanzania and Zambia received grants to support their work to highlight
      and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent. \n\nThese initiatives
      included [a student-founded project in Nigeria](http://www.peoplescheck.org/)
      to fact-check and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that
      has affected people's health and lives, a [Somali language radio station](https://www.daljir.com/)
      that ran media literacy campaigns and radio reporting in Puntland and Galmudug
      regions to bring health facts to the public and [a Guinean network of volunteers](http://www.zeropauvreafrique.org)
      that tracked and deconstructed false information around the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nOther
      awards included a [Tanzanian campaign](https://www.instagram.com/constructiveactivism/)
      to document and share information around injustices, human rights abuse and
      repressions associated to COVID-19 interventions in the country in collaboration
      with human rights defenders, activists and local artists, a Kenyan social media
      campaign to highlight violence against women related to the pandemic, and a
      [youth-led fact checking news bulletin](https://mciug.org/) to debunk fake stories
      trending on social media in Uganda.\n\nThe grantees will share their experiences
      at a knowledge-sharing forum where they can discuss their experiences and challenges
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic during an event on 17 November. Also invited
      to the panel are the [Check Global partners](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
      from Sub-Saharan Africa, [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/) and [CITE](https://cite.org.zw/).\n\nIf
      you would like to know more about our Sub-Saharan Africa event, please contact
      Eric Mugendi at <mugendi@meedan.com>."
