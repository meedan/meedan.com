    long_description: "Meedan is hosting a closed-door panel on COVID-19 and local
      news on October 5, 2020.  It’s called *COVID-19 Local News Forum: What does
      the second wave of COVID-19 reporting look like?*\n\n[Dr. Seema Yasmin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/seema-yasmin)
      will facilitate a town-hall style forum between Meedan’s in-house team of scientists
      and a variety of local news outlets across the United States. \n\nWith the first
      nine months of the pandemic behind us, and in anticipation of a second wave
      this fall, we are aiming for this discussion to serve as an opportunity to reflect
      on how local news reporting fared during the early stages of this global crisis.
      We’ll also work together to design new paths forward for scientists and journalists
      as reporting needs increase around emerging treatments, vaccines and projected
      upticks in transmission.\n\nThe event is scheduled for Monday October 5 from
      12:30-2 PM ET (9:30-11AM PT)."
