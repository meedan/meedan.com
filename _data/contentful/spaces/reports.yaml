  body: "In early 2020, the introduction of COVID-19 in the MENA region found its
    epicenter in Iran. The country’s outbreak preceded much of the rest of the world,
    and during the outset of the crisis the Iranian government’s slow reaction and
    delayed quarantines ignited ridicule internationally. Online and offline misinformation
    were part of the country’s battle with the virus. In this chapter, we highlight
    three main aspects that have shaped the spread of coronavirus misinformation in
    Iran; a) the lack of public trust in officials, b) religiously charged narratives
    by unofficial fringe figures, c) political manipulation of the discourse around
    the virus. We end this chapter by focusing on the counter measures implemented
    and the limitations that enabled the dissemination of the misleading content.\n\n###
    Trust Crisis in Iran\n\n#### Political Turbulence and Trust\n\nIn the months leading
    up to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran, there was an increase in distrust in Iran’s
    official institutions. Following November 2019 protests that resulted in what
    is suspected to have been thousands of deaths, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the
    country’s wide-reaching military corps<sup><a id=\"fnref1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup>,
    and the (semi) elected Iranian government faced a crisis of legitimacy. In addition,
    the downing and the subsequent coverup of the Ukraine Airlines passenger jet in
    January 2020 by the Guards led to a new round of protests ([Behravesh, Jan. 14,
    2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iran-plane-shoot-protest-crisis-competency-legitimacy-200113151404256.html)).\n\nAs
    COVID-19 began to take hold in the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei,
    President Rouhani, the Ministry of Health and other officials initially played
    down the pandemic, in fear that the virus would lower voter turnout for the country’s
    February election ([BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Less reported in the media are the other issues and events that have eroded public
    trust against these authorities throughout the pandemic: Channels affiliated to
    the Revolutionary Guards and state affiliated news channels promoted conspiracy
    theories about the virus’s origins. Masaf Institute for example, a cultural and
    economic institution affiliated with Revolutionary Guard under the leadership
    of a well-known and cult-like conspiracy theorist, Ali Akbar Raefipour, stood
    out amongst these channels. They used their “health” Telegram channel called [@masaf_salam](https://t.me/masaf_salam)
    as well as it’s main channel [@masaf](https://t.me/masaf), to promote a wide range
    of conspiracies about the origins of the virus. Other accounts belonging or affiliated
    with the Revolutionary Guards such [@afsaran_ir](https://t.me/Afsaran_ir), [@sepah_cyberi](https://t.me/c/1153794295/4589),
    [@sepahcyberi](https://t.me/sepahcybery) were also actors promoting such theories.
    However, they further dramatized and promoted conspiracy theories that were being
    promoted in Iran’s official media regarding the virus as an attack by the US against
    Iran.\n\nWhile political information worked to divide and blame the origins of
    the virus, influential channels on the popular messaging service Telegram, even
    some associated with hardline and traditional institutions such as the Revolutionary
    Guards, were providing credible information by at least, [29 February](https://t.me/c/1153794295/2423),
    asking followers to follow social distancing measures and sharing videos of medical
    staff asking Iranians to stay home to save lives. \n\n#### Religious Figures Fill
    Trust Vacuum\n\nOur analysis of social media found examples of religiously-charged
    COVID-19 messages promoted in India, the US, and MENA countries such as Iran.
    It is the latter that we focus on in this report. There is no doubt that Islam
    prohibts the spreading of unverified information, gossipes, and rumours<sup><a
    id=\"fnref2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup>. Yet, with a deficit of public trust
    in authorities, opportunities for information sharing have been allocated to unqualified
    actors, most significantly, clerics and religious figures. \n\nIn Iran, where
    some Shiite Muslim religious figures often use their faith as a pillar of opposition
    against westernization, a fringe figure named Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian has come
    to be known as “the father of Islamic medicine.” Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19,
    Tabrizian [posted a video](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian/6965) in January
    of himself burning a copy of _Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine_, an
    American reference textbook of medicine used globally. Tabrizian accused the book
    of being “a tool of the West’s infiltration of other countries” in a video sermon
    posted to his Telegram channel. \n\nThose who follow Tabrizian’s thinking against
    modern medicine are known to refuse to vaccinate, or follow medical advice, for
    major illnesses including cancer diagnoses ([Faghihi, Mar. 10, 2020](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/bizarre-cures-for-coronavirus-in-iran.html)).
    On 25 February, as the coronavirus crisis unfolded in Iran, Tabrizian advised
    followers infected with the virus to swab their anus’ with a piece of cotton dipped
    in violet oil (See Figure 1). The [post](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)
    has gone viral on his Telegram channel of over 200,000 followers and beyond onto
    other Persian language social media, with mixed reactions that included both ridicule
    and adherence to Tabrizian’s messaging. \n\n![meedan covid-19-report iran Ayatollah-Abbas-Tabrizian-official-Telegram-3](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7tCYRd8B523rGfF2DF4UTt/ae60d6c86fc30b83d24f38ce0e1ce0d4/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Ayatollah-Abbas-Tabrizian-official-Telegram-3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 1: A screenshot from Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian’s official
    Telegram page. In a 25 February 2020 post, he lists 13 actions to take in an effort
    to battle an infection against coronavirus. Point 8 has been particularly shocking,
    where he advises infected followers to swab their anus with violet oil before
    bed. This screenshot was taken by the authors on 28 March 2020.</p>\n\nAnother
    controversial video that circulated across Persian language social media shows
    Mortazavi Kohsal, known to be a disciple of Ayatollah Tabrizian ([Saeedian, Mar.
    23, 2020](https://twitter.com/mahdiarsaeedian/status/1241289478301499392); Bahar
    News, Mar. 23, 2020). As he claims to practice Islamic medicine, Kohsal visits
    critically ill and quarantined coronavirus patients, while wearing no protective
    clothes or gear, to rub a liquid he claimed to be “the perfume of the Prophet”
    on the patients lips in the city of Anzali in Gilan. Two days later, one of the
    young patients Kohsal rubbed the perfume died from the virus ([Bahar News, Mar.
    23, 2020](http://www.baharnews.ir/news/206368/%D8%AF%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%B0%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%83%D9%87%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84)).
    \n\nMehdi Sabili, another follower of Tabrizian, similarly circulated a viral
    video recommending camel urine as a coronavirus remedy. Authorities arrested himfor
    creating “confusion and anxiety” for the public, and undermining the countries
    “Islamic and medicinal values” in addition to running a Islamic Medicine clinic
    in Tehran without a license  ([YJC, Apr. 22, 2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7327494/%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%BA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D8%AF)).
    \n\n#### Protection for Religious Misinformers\n\nCriticisms against these actors
    and their contribution to fatal dangers within the Iranian establishment are aplenty
    ([Radio Farda, Dec. 29, 2020](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/successor-to-khamenei-died-because-he-trusted-islamic-medicine-son-reveals/30349899.html)).
    However the phenomenon remains protected from official reproach through Tabrizian’s
    entrenched networks amongst Iran’s clerical elite. While two of Tabrizian’s disciples
    have been arrested after causing outrage in both internal Iranian and international
    media, Tabrizian has been left untouched. His honorific title of “Ayatollah” has
    never been questioned for removal by Iran’s Shiite seminaries ([YJC, Apr. 23,
    2020](https://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/7328801/%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%BE%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85))<sup><a
    id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>.  \n\nIn February 2020, three Iranian
    doctors who condemned Tabrizian’s medical advice were sentenced to flogging in
    the city of Mashhad ([Asr Iran, Feb. 9, 2020](https://www.asriran.com/fa/news/712989/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AA-3-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86))<sup><a
    id=\"fnref4\" href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a></sup>. While the doctors were later [acquitted](https://www.irna.ir/news/83761292/%D8%B3%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF),
    these arrests highlight Tabrizian’s influence with authorities. Furthermore, a
    journalist running the Telegram channel for the semi-official Iranian Labour News
    Agency (ILNA) was arrested on 23 April for posting a satirical cartoon of Tabrizian
    and his suggested coronavirus remedies on the basis of insulting the Supreme Leader
    Khamenei. The cartoon depicted Khamenei as a nurse asking for silence as he allows
    for remedies to be applied to a coronavirus patient ([RFE/RL, Apr. 28, 2020](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-arrests-editor-journalist-over-cartoon-mocking-khamenei/30581070.html)).
    Popular platforms such as the Iranian alternative to YouTube, Aparat, that strictly
    adhere to Iran’s censorship regulations ([Center for Human Rights in Iran, Nov.
    29, 2017](https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/11/after-fiery-speech-iran-censors-ahmadinejad-related-online-searches/))
    leaves the official pages for Tabrizian prescribing and promoting remedies unchecked
    (see the page for Tabrizian’s archive of speeches [here](https://www.aparat.com/tebeslamiclip),
    and his office’s official channel [here](https://www.aparat.com/daftareayatollahtabrizian)).\n\nReligious
    authorities also falsely believed sacred protection would prevent the virus from
    spreading in religious shrines, and resistance to closing down the religious shrines
    in the city of Qom, where the virus had its first outbreak in Iran, was a contributing
    factor to the spread of the disease ([Batrawy, Feb. 25, 2020](https://apnews.com/7b8f420db1a339116d66bc55c9085d7c)).
    However, as the pandemic has carried on for a few months, some clerical figures,
    especially in Qom, have come to be seen as community leaders in guiding public
    health on good advice ([Bozorgmehr, Jun. 17, 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/8e9b50bb-ebf7-4702-9894-1f2081ae869a)).\n\nDespite
    many authorities condemning “religious misinformation”, it was still a phenomenon
    that contributed to Iran’s _infodemic_. The combination of communications platforms
    allowing for wider audiences for fanatical solutions have contributed to the reach
    and impact of dangerous ideas and remedies. Politically, the spread of the virus
    from a holy Shiite centre such as Qom has fueled the existing sectarian tensions
    within the Gulf region and Lebanon. Scapegoating problems of coronavirus to Shiite
    Islam has contributed to eroding civil rights against already persecuted minority
    Shiite communities in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain ([Matthiesen, Mar. 23, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2020-03-23/coronavirus-exacerbating-sectarian-tensions-middle-east)).\n\n####
    The Alcohol Epidemic Within the Pandemic: Not Part of the Online Infodemic\n\nTo
    date, over 300 Iranians have died and another 1,000 were poisoned by alcohol during
    the pandemic ([Karimi and Gambrell, Mar. 27, 2020](https://apnews.com/6e04783f95139b5f87a5febe28d72015?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP)).
    Contrary to some sources promoted by foriegn media, this was not a problem found
    in the “online infodemic.<sup><a id=\"fnref5\" href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>” Alcohol
    related deaths have long been a problem in Iran. Conditions of the lockdown have
    just exacerbated it. \n\nAs an Islamic theocracy, alcohol is banned in the country
    but still widely consumed. Iranians have different ways of acquiring alcohol.
    There are alcohol dealers that sell various imported alcoholic drinks, typically
    at very high prices. A cheaper alternative, however, is making the alcohol at
    home or purchasing alcohol distilled in illegal local workshops. The latter options
    are often the source of poorly made distillations that lead to methanol poisoning.
    In fact, alcohol related deaths due to these poisonous distillations have long
    been a public health crisis in Iran, well before the introduction of the coronavirus
    ([Hekmat et al 2012](http://ircmj.com/articles/15765.html)). Alcohol poisoning
    has increased during the pandemic as more people have been looking to occupy their
    time at home by drinking; falsely interpreting alcohol consumption as a coronavirus
    disinfectant or remedy; and an increase in dealers selling poisonous alcohol ([Hamshari](http://newspaper.hamshahrionline.ir/id/96869/36%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%87.html)[
    Online, Mar. 14 2020](http://newspaper.hamshahrionline.ir/id/96869/36%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%87.html)).
    This, combined with Iran’s existing issues of trust and access to information
    factors surrounding the virus in Iran have intensified into a record amount of
    deaths.\n\n### The Role of Geopolitics in Misinformation\n\n#### Conspiracy Theories\n\nPolitical
    leaders in Iran have spread conspiracy theories that accuse other countries of
    spreading the virus. High ranking officials of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards
    Corps (IRGC), as well as the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei have spread the
    conspiracy theory that coronavirus is part of an American led bio attack against
    Iran within the country’s officialdom ([Haghdoost and Motevalli, Mar. 12, ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/iran-s-khamenei-says-virus-outbreak-may-be-biological-attack)[2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/iran-s-khamenei-says-virus-outbreak-may-be-biological-attack)).
    \n\nWhile some unofficial religious leaders promoted remedies, Iranian officials
    promoted fake virus testing technologies, making a mockery of the states efforts
    to combat the deadly virus. In what seemed like a show, the IRGC unveiled what
    was advertised as a “coronavirus remote detector” that could locate people infected
    within a 100 meters range. News about the unveiling ceremony on the 15th of April
    was published throughout Iran’s press and spread throughout international media.
    Links about this poorly-designed public diplomacy/propaganda attempt have circulated
    on Twitter for its “scientific capacity” (see Figure2). \n\n![meedan covid-19-report
    iran Press-TV-screenshot-3](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/2JcRouH88cRjNCjkQ11dlQ/191c9729314ed1c17fa59c2f1485a0cf/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_Press-TV-screenshot-3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 2: A screenshot of a Tweet by Press TV supporting the
    IRGC’s coronavirus detector. The screenshot was taken by the authors on the 25th
    of April 2020.</p>\n\n#### Information Controls\n\nOne argument about international
    coverage of the coronavirus in Iran however, is that Iran’s place as a “bad actor”
    or “pariah” state within the world, especially as a force countering U.S hegemony
    in the Middle East, has led to unbalanced reporting on the situation of the virus
    in Iran. As one of the first countries hit by the virus, analysis of Iran’s inadequate
    response was perceived as a shocking and singular demonstration of Iran’s incompetence.
    However, as the virus became a pandemic overtaking almost every country in the
    world, it became evident incompetence and inadequacy were not singular to Iran.
    Many advanced democracies struggled just as Iran did. This imbalance in foreign
    media coverage further exasperated confusions in what trusted sources could be.
    Authorities made an extra effort to tarnish the work of foreign media coverage
    of the virus in Iran as malicious.  In May. President Rouhani announced foreign
    media purposely manipulated news of the virus to “close down our country” ([IRNA
    News, May. 16, 2020](https://www.irna.ir/news/83789038/%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A8%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B7%DB%8C%D9%84-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF)).
    \n\nNevertheless, manipulation campaigns have been tied to Iran. The “International
    Union of Virtual Media” (IUVM) has been uncovered as an influence campaign tied
    to Iran by researchers at Graphika, FireEye, and Facebook ([Graphika, Apr. 14,
    2020](https://graphika.com/reports/irans-iuvm-turns-to-coronavirus/)). On 28 February
    BBC Persian published a whistleblower report that proved the number of deaths
    in Iran far exceeded the government reports ([BBC, Feb. 28, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51673053)).
    Shortly afterwards IUVM TV ran a smear campaign calling BBC Persian reporting
    a British conspiracy to undermine Iranian authorities (see figure 3). \n\n![A
    screenshot of a video posted on the IUVM website](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1YmSSDLn4bT5xi0dHqRBP0/3273db2399cd30487084692c9e141449/meedan_covid-19-report_iran_IUVM-website-screenshot_3.png)\n<p
    class=\"caption\">Figure 3: A screenshot of a video posted on the IUVM website,
    indicating BBC Persian’s reporting on Iran’s coronavirus cases and responses are
    part of a British conspiracy against Iran. The screenshot was taken by the authors
    on the 25th of April 2020.</p> \n\nGeopolitical warfare over controlling the coronavirus
    narrative continues alongside the censorship of major social media platforms,
    including  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Telegram and major international media
    outlets such as BBC Persian. This has helped place hurdles on access to trusted
    information, especially pertinent during the start of the spread of the virus.
    \n\nPrior to the country’s parliamentary elections information sources about the
    virus were scarce if not only on censored platforms. However, the government denied
    the arrival of the virus as “disinformation” being spread through social media
    ([BBC Persian, Feb. 16 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51521216)). \n\nFear
    of contradicting the government has also stopped many Iranians from sharing information
    online. There have been a number of arrests of medical workers exposing the true
    extent of the medical catastrophe ([ARTICLE19](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/),
    Mar. 27,[ 2020](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/)).
    Some criticism of the government’s public health responses led to high profile
    arrests, such as Shiraz City Councillor Mehdi Hajati, who on his [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mehdihajati/status/1237649682953715712)
    criticized authorities that did not quarantine Qom as the enemy of the people.\n\nIn
    many addresses to the nation President Rouhani has warned of a coronavirus _infodemic_
    ([Tasnim, Mar. 14, 2020](https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1398/12/24/2222979/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B4-%D8%AF%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%85)).
    While figures such as Tabrizian have been exempt, authorities have been known
    to crack down on those criticizing the states as opposed to actors producing dangerous
    misinformation.\n\n### Counter-Measures\n\nWhile misinformation is circulated,
    counter-measures were barely implemented in the MENA region. Old coercive methods
    have been imposed, like arrests. MENA governments have launched more “threats”
    to those who spread rumours – or anything that contradicts the official news –
    on social media in relation to coronavirus, accusing them of affecting the public
    order.Coronavirus “misinformation” has become another reason to put more people
    behind bars in this region. There have been a number of arrests in Iran due to
    spreading “misinformation” on social media. To enforce that, the Iranian government
    created a task force to combat “misinformation” and “the spread of fear” leading
    to at least 24 arrests ([ARTICLE19, Mar. 27. 2020](https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-coronavirus-crisis-highlights-need-for-the-free-flow-of-information/)).
    While official measures did not help counter the spread of misinformation, measures
    implemented by social media platforms did not seem to help either. \n\n#### Social
    Media Platforms and Misinformation\n\nSocial media use in Western contexts are
    mainly dominated by platforms owned by Google, Facebook and Twitter. Although
    they operate imperfectly, there have been channels for criticism and accountability
    for the policies and decisions these companies take for fighting misinformation
    by civil society and governments. Within the Iranian context, the platforms used
    are more complex. According to a 2019 poll done by the Islamic Student Polling
    Agency, the top three most used social media applications (not including streaming
    platforms) are WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram (in that order of popularity)
    ([ISPA, Apr. 30, 2019](http://ispa.ir/Default/Details/fa/2095)). [Iran’s Alexa
    ranking](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/IR) for websites also lists
    the local video streaming platform Aparat as the second most visited website in
    Iran . \n\nWhat is emblematic of Iran’s information spaces are the lack of oversight
    that can be afforded to flag or remove false information. Viral news stories or
    videos forwarded in private chats or WhatsApp groups have become an emblem of
    COVID19’s Iranian infodemic. As researchers, this phenomenon is hard to track
    and trace across WhatsApp beyond interviews done with Iranians. In terms of oversight
    of the virality of false information on the platform, WhatsApp has struggled to
    find solutions. These struggles are naturally inherent in the nature of the platform
    as a private and encrypted messaging<sup><a id=\"fnref6\" href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup>.
    \ \n\nAs the second most popular social media platform in Iran, Telegram’s major
    role lies in its public channels, which have been a platform for false information
    during the coronavirus pandemic. Content moderation policies on Telegram are notoriously
    more lax and subject to fewer accountability oversight mechanisms. This might
    be a product of how niche its social media function is within only certain communities
    or countries. However, as the “infodemic” within the coronavirus pandemic has
    become a global issue of universal relevance in almost every community and country,
    Telegram introduced a system to verify its channels in April in order to fight
    against dangerous coronavirus mis/disinformation<sup><a id=\"fnref7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a></sup>.\n\n####
    Misinformation Mitigation in Iran\n\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, problematic
    channels such as that of [Ayatollah ](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)[Tabrizian’](https://t.me/DaftareAyatollahTabrizian)s,
    propagating false remedies according to the dictates of his own school of “Islamic
    Medicine” have circulated unchecked. However, many channels affiliated with authorities
    did publish legitimate information that might have been ignored due to the crisis
    of legitimacy that exists between citizens and authorities.\n\nIn an official
    attempt to raise awareness, the Iranian government raised concerns about coronavirus
    misinformation as an issue mainly from “enemies.” Before official orders were
    given to lockdown public spaces, businesses, and restaurants in Iran, President
    Rouhani indicated “it is the conspiracy of our enemies to create fear to shut
    down our country” ([BBC Persian, Feb. 25, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-51630282)).
    Instead of promoting media literacy in the country, the government flagged these
    warnings to further cement the theory of “western influence” in creating or worsening
    the situation or to deflect from government criticism. While official efforts
    were lacking to counter the spread of misleading information in Iran, independent
    fact-checking efforts were also lacking.\n\n#### Independent Fact-Checking\n\nThe
    MENA region, in general, lacks fact-checking efforts. Only a few local fact checkers
    work on countering Arabic and Persian misinformation in relation to coronavirus
    at the time of writing. AFP Factual and Fatabyyano are among those few entities
    that run coronavirus fact checking efforts, and act as the official Facebook third-party
    fact checkers in the region (See more on [Google Fact Check Tools](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer/search/coronavirus;hl=)
    and [IFCN](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories)). Others, in
    a less formal way, run fact-checking efforts like Verify-Syria, Factnameh, Matsda2sh,
    and Misbar – all are currently focusing on coronavirus fact-checking. [BBC Monitoring](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51677530)
    has done some work to dispel misinformation on Persian social media, however their
    analyses are only in the English language ([Sardarizadeh, Feb. 29, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530)).
    \n\nHowever, this region lacks fact-checking efforts, social media platforms have
    also never prioritized collaborating with third-party fact checkers in the region.To
    this date, Facebook, for example, has only two partners that cover the entire
    MENA region ([Elswah & Howard, Mar. 29, 2020](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/tunisia-election-memo/)).
    While social media platforms have spent resources in directing their users to
    accurate coronavirus-information in the MENA region, a lot still needs to be done,
    including developing their algorithms, content moderation, and fact-checking.\n\n###
    Conclusions\n\nThe world is currently witnessing an unprecedented challenge that
    threatens people’s lives. The MENA region has long been suffering from other problems
    like illiteracy, corruption, and authoritarianism. Coronavirus has added one more
    challenge to this region’s unprepared governments. In this short report, we presented
    how coronavirus has been used for religious and political polarization. While
    we focused our attention on Iran -the epicenter of the virus in the region- there
    are systemic issues that plague the information environment in Iran that are reflected
    into the rest of the region. From issues of unofficial religious actors, lack
    of trust in authorities, and political polarisations. \n\nWhile Islam encourages
    Muslims to verify information and prohibit its followers from misleading others,
    some unofficial religious figures used their authority and connections to the
    political elite to mislead their communities and have remained unpenalized. Religious
    misinformation has had the ability to further politicize government responses
    to this pandemic. From shifting government accountability about appropriate measures
    to quarantine epicentres, to using excuses to persecute religious minorities in
    Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Politicization of the pandemic across geopolitical tensions
    has been a particular highlight in the spread of misinformation from officialdom
    across the MENA region. \n\nConspiracy theories about American bio-attacks against
    Iran have led to pressure to go as far as to stop Doctors Without Borders from
    setting up and manning a hospital in the city of Isfahan as a continuation of
    long-standing projects in Iran and coordinated with the country’s Ministry of
    Health ([MSF, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/iranian-authorities-revoke-approval-msf-coronavirus-treatment-center);
    [Motevalli, Mar. 24, 2020](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/french-charity-msf-says-iran-coronavirus-aid-is-on-hold)).
    Information control practices such as internet censorship and arrests of critics
    of the government has further added to the deficit in public trust against governments
    in this region. This has exacerbated the spread of misinformation, leading to
    hundreds of fatalities. \n\nWhile the MENA region has not monopolized examples
    of coronavirus misinformation, the examples we outlined above highlight the deeper
    problems of authoritarianism, literacy (or digital literacy), sectarian tensions,
    and geopolitical conflicts that are worsening what should be a region united—in
    terms of nations, regions, and religions—against a global pandemic that knows
    no borders. "

  body: "In this paper, we focus on our experience of harmful false information about
    health in Kenya. We identify major trends and discuss the contextual factors influencing
    mis- and disinformation in the country. We show that while there has been a surge
    in false information linked to Covid-19, this is not new to the country, with
    health myths that lead to vaccine hesitancy having a long tail, for example. Finally,
    we suggest areas that fact-checkers can look into to counter harmful health mis-
    and disinformation.\n\n### Introduction\n\nFalse information about health causes
    real harm to people’s lives. Africa Check has been fact-checking public statements
    about health in Kenya since late 2016. \n\nIn our first two years of operation
    in the country we focused on claims made by public figures, institutions or the
    media that we judged would cause the most harm if left unchallenged. In that period
    our experience was mainly of **misinformation**, with many journalists, people
    and entities publicly sharing content that they likely did not know was false.\n\nThis
    ranged from government officials making inaccurate claims about the prevalence
    of HIV/AIDS in adolescents at major international meetings<sup><a id=\"fnref1\"
    href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup> to poor fact-checking by both local and international
    media, with cited statistics often being either deficient<sup><a id=\"fnref2\"
    href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup> or non-existent<sup><a id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>.\n\nOur
    experience of **disinformation** (deliberately falsified information) in that
    period included dangerous claims about vaccines, with significant opposition fanned
    by conservative groups to tetanus vaccines<sup><a id=\"fnref4\" href=\"#fn4\">[4]</a></sup>
    for example. Churches play a major role in Kenyan society and were quite instrumental
    in seeding this. We have seen a resurgence of disinformation around vaccines due
    to the Covid-19 pandemic, including claims<sup><a id=\"fnref5\" href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>
    that the continent would be used for trials.\n\nThere has also been broader public
    awareness about disinformation in recent years, resulting in more people flagging
    questionable health content to us. This has given us greater insight into the
    types of false information shared in the country, from the occasional hoax to
    outright fabricated content and miracle cures for cancer<sup><a id=\"fnref6\"
    href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup> and other diseases of concern to Kenyans. \n\nBut
    we have noted **two key trends** in the country that are pre-eminent:\n\n- The
    use of **false context** (including false connection and clickbait headlines)\n-
    \ **Manipulation** of genuine content\n\nDecontextualisation often involves the
    use of genuine imagery re-shared as new, whether during everyday discussions of
    public health or during a major news event such as the Covid-19 crisis. Certain
    media, such as pictures and videos, have an intrinsic ability to make text appear
    more believable.\n\nManipulation is mainly doctored or tampered-with content.
    It is also notable that the two types of disinformation provide a low “barrier
    to entry” compared to say, deepfakes — or even shallowfakes.\n\nWhat the two have
    in common is the use of genuine content as a starting point. But there is also
    an added element of profit-seeking involved where believability is used to scam
    people or drive traffic to websites. This is rather surprising as we expected
    that, for reasons of structural deficiency around healthcare, including affordability,
    most false information would be about cures. \n\nHowever, it isn’t completely
    dissociated. The use of genuine content as a jumping-off point provides a sort
    of beachhead strategy into the other forms of disinformation mentioned, whether
    being screenshots appearing to be from credible sources that push false information
    to those that rely on heuristics to stoke emotion and drive virality.   \n\nThis
    is important from the perspective of both amplification and fact-checking, because
    studies show that content with a kernel of truth tends to be most shared<sup><a
    id=\"fnref7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a></sup>, and is also best countered by acknowledging
    this<sup><a id=\"fnref8\" href=\"#fn8\">[8]</a></sup>.\n\n### Contextual factors
    influencing mis- and disinformation in Kenya \n\nA number of factors are at play.
    All broadly coalesce around financial, political, and social and cultural motivations.
    \n\n- Of the 9.9 million people who use the internet in the country, 6.3 million
    — nearly two-thirds (64%) — are young people aged between 15 and 34<sup><a id=\"fnref9\"
    href=\"#fn9\">[9]</a></sup>. **But digital literacy remains low, with a notable
    digital divide where many are offline.** Our research<sup><a id=\"fnref10\" href=\"#fn10\">[10]</a></sup>
    also shows that while all demographics are vulnerable to false information, older
    people and people with lower levels of education in general are at increased fallibility.
    \n\n- **Youth unemployment** is also high<sup><a id=\"fnref11\" href=\"#fn11\">[11]</a></sup>,
    with many young people seeking to leverage the country’s increased connectivity
    to gain from a growing digital economy. This informs why false health information
    often involves scams seeking to make profit by duping potential job applicants,
    sites looking to make money off advertising and those people looking to sell hope
    to the desperate through false and untested cures. \n\n- There is also **low investment
    in quality public healthcare**, while private hospitals are largely still out
    of reach for most. In many families in Kenya, a cancer diagnosis is a sure path
    to financial ruin. This makes many Kenyans particularly vulnerable to unproven
    cures being peddled on social networks.\n\n- **Culture** also plays a role. Worldviews
    in Kenya tend to lean towards the communal rather than the ideological, and are
    very experiential. Community leaders for example have a lot of influence on society,
    and beliefs play an elevated role in how information is processed. False cures
    and anti-vaccination positions pushed by figures of authority are some of the
    ways this is manifested.Related to this is an inherent elevation of social consensus
    information. There is an innate belief that because a certain piece of information
    is being shared in groups Kenyans are members of (such as Whatsapp groups), it
    is being done in good faith and that it also is “pre-verified” and accurate. This
    informs why authority figures successfully share false information — such as a
    prominent senator who claimed<sup><a id=\"fnref12\" href=\"#fn12\">[12]</a></sup>
    soya causes breast cancer, or Nairobi’s incumbent governor claiming<sup><a id=\"fnref13\"
    href=\"#fn13\">[13]</a></sup> that alcohol is a ‘throat disinfectant’ against
    the new coronavirus.\n\n- There is also **a distrust of authority**, though not
    of experts, giving alternative voices such as bloggers and influencers a growing
    audience. These invest their time capital into the system for a return in social
    capital (likes and follows), and in algorithmic capital. Facebook groups and trending
    topics are for example quite influential in Kenya, and the players use this mainly
    for economic capital, in a sort of permissive feedback loop well outlined by Danil
    Mikhailov<sup><a id=\"fnref14\" href=\"#fn14\">[14]</a></sup>.\n\n### Examples
    of mis- and disinformation in Kenya\n\n#### Incorrect public pronouncements not
    based on, and/or misrepresenting verifiable data\n\nNairobi governor Mike Sonko
    [includes alcohol in food packs](https://africacheck.org/spot-check/nairobi-governor-sonko-puts-families-at-risk-with-coronavirus-busting-alcohol-in-food-packs/)
    to poor families, claiming that “alcohol plays a very major role in killing the
    coronavirus or any sort of virus”.\n\n#### False cures/prevention regimens\n\nFalse
    cancer cures from [a mysterious ‘Dr Gupta’](https://africacheck.org/spot-check/beware-false-cancer-cures-from-dr-gupta-on-facebook/)
    — that cancer will “disappear” if patients stop eating sugar, drink lemon juice
    before meals for three months, and take spoonfuls of coconut oil morning and night
    — go viral on Facebook.\n\n#### Hoaxes and scams\n\n[Job openings at WHO for a
    high salary](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/coronavirus-job-scam-no-world-health-organization-kenya-not-hiring-on-facebook/):
    applicants were asked to submit their personal information, with enough information
    being asked for to initiate identity theft. \n\n#### Manipulated and/or out-of-context
    videos and images\n\n [‘Every Kenyan to receive 100K due to the lockdown on corona’](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-false-news-of-ksh100000-payout-for-every-kenyan-during-covid-19-lockdown-not-broadcast-on-citizen-tv/)\n\n####
    Conspiracy theories and predictions\n\n“[Barack Obama is asking Africans not to
    accept vaccines that will come from America and Europe](https://africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-former-us-president-obama-didnt-warn-africans-against-coronavirus-vaccines/)”.\n\n###
    Covid-19 disinformation in Kenya\n\nAfrica Check has looked at false information
    about Covid-19 mainly through the lens of disinformation, with content where the
    intent could be safely assessed as not meant to mislead or cause harm left out.
    Since March 2020 we have maintained an updated “[live guide](https://africacheck.org/reports/live-guide-all-our-coronavirus-fact-checks-in-one-place/)”,
    with decontextualized content — imagery and articles — forming the bulk of the
    entries for Kenya, for reasons discussed elsewhere in this report, key being the
    low barriers to entry. \n\n\n**Hoaxes**, fabricated content about non-existent
    events and entities, **half-truths,** where truths swim in the same waters as
    misleading claims, and **scams** with a financial motive are also key players
    in the Kenyan false information ecosystem. The prevalence of half-truths is especially
    effective — infusing false claims with plausible ones adds to the overall believability.
    \n\n**Cures and vaccines** are the next main types of pandemic disinformation.
    Many claims about cures come with a profit element in the background, such as
    buying a “natural” product or visiting a practitioner. Claims about vaccines are
    often caught up in the country’s strong conservative beliefs or protests about
    Africans being guinea pigs. \n\n### How false information about health in Kenya
    compares internationally\n\nLike in many other countries, the false health information
    that is shared in Kenya tends to be that which evokes emotional responses. But
    there are some differences.\n\nA lot of health mis- and disinformation in the
    Global North tends to be grounded in **ideology**, but there is little evidence
    of this in Kenya. This is a reason why harmful false information that is Kenya-specific
    originates on social and professional media, as opposed to, say, the anonymous
    web or conspiracy communities as is often the case elsewhere.\n\n**Relationships**
    also come before purpose in Kenya. Mis- and disinformation that taps into these
    networks — such as families and communities — is quite widely shared. \n\nFurther,
    due to how information leaches into the community (community meetings are crucibles
    for the individual to act on (false) information), disinformation often has more
    impact — for example a lot of stigma around Covid-19 patients has been experienced
    in Kenyan communities, sometimes with fatal outcomes. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe
    entire information ecosystem — government, the media, big tech, fact-checkers
    and audiences — has a role to play in countering health mis- and disinformation.
    \n\nBut there are some areas fact-checkers can look into:\n\n- Disinformation
    in particular in Kenya very often thrives by leveraging on **relationships**,
    because a lot of people have an emotional rather than rational or logical relationship
    to information. \n- **Indigenisation of fact-checking is important**: Our fact-checking
    work in 11 other African languages generated a lot of interest because it helps
    break accurate information out of the urban ivory towers where it is still very
    much concentrated. Others like the BBC have gone into localisation of content
    in much more detail<sup><a id=\"fnref15\" href=\"#fn15\">[15]</a></sup>.\n- More
    research into **how individual/societal differences such as culture affect responses
    to false** **health** **information** is needed. We need to better understand
    the circumstances that make fact-checking have any impact on politicians and how
    to make it a durable effect. How can we persuade the alcohol-peddling Nairobi
    governor to check himself?\n- Should we cloak up like mis/disinformation peddlers?
    For example, we know that adding an image to a tweet can make the difference between
    a fact-check that gets seen, and one that is outranked by more attention-grabbing
    posts. We’ve in the past debunked false health information with video, and we
    are already sending audio to our audiences. Should it be a standard? This is very
    much a point of debate<sup><a id=\"fnref16\" href=\"#fn16\">[16]</a></sup>."

  body: "On March 12, 2020 China’s deputy director of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
    Zhao Lijian published an unusual tweet. It claimed that the United States army
    brought COVID-19 to China when the country participated in the October 2019 Military
    Olympic Games.<sup><a id=\"fnref1\" href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a></sup> The claim, if
    not a conspiracy, was not supported by any evidence. It spread like wildfire,
    becoming a global piece of misinformation about the origin of the pandemic.\n\nA
    few days later, disinformation messages arrived on the cell phones and social
    media feeds of individual American citizens. One post read, “The Trump administration
    is about to lock down the entire country,\" which was later confirmed to be false.
    United States officials considered the tactic an unprecedented move by Chinese
    agents<sup><a id=\"fnref2\" href=\"#fn2\">[2]</a></sup>.\n\nThe University of
    Hong Kong’s censorship monitoring project, Weiboscope, monitors the Chinese social
    platform Weibo for disinformation, misinformation and censorship. Weibo is China's
    equivalent to Twitter, and Weiboscope offers key insights into how information
    control manifests on one of China's most prominent social networks. As the Chinese
    government exerts information control over COVID-19 narratives inside China, the
    international impact of state censorship becomes a significant global issue. \n\nOn
    the afternoon of December 31, 2019 a Weibo post read, “Wuhan pneumonia cannot
    be judged to be SARS. Wuhan has the only virus laboratory in the country and is
    also a world-class virology laboratory. There are ways to deal with the virus.
    If Wuhan can't figure it out, no one can handle it.” It was swiftly censored within
    an hour. \n\nThe post mentioned both the SARS-like nature of the virus, suggesting
    its high infection rate, and the Wuhan laboratory, signalling the origin of the
    virus. Based on our knowledge of the government’s censorship system, both of these
    characteristics seem to be attributable to the decision to remove the post from
    the social platform. \n\nAt the time, social media was already circulating speculations
    that an unknown pneumonia was linked to a SARS-like disease, according to Weiboscope
    data. Ophthalmologist Dr. Li Wenliang, who learned about the then-mysterious illness
    in a hospital, had sent a message in the popular Chinese private messaging app
    WeChat, to warn other medical doctors about the unnamed illness. Wenliang was
    then accused, with another six people, of disturbance of public order by the local
    authority (Green, 2020).\n\nOn December 31, 2019, the same day the post was removed
    from Weibo and shortly after Wenliang's warning, the Chinese government claimed
    the “viral pneumonia cases” had “no apparent pattern of human-to-human transmission”
    and were “preventable and controllable” (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, 2019).
    The Chinese government then also informed the World Health Organization and the
    United States of its position.\n\nLess than a month later on January 20th, the
    Chinese central government announced the COVID-19 epidemic to the public (Phillips
    et al., 2020). A group of leading Chinese virologists appeared on a state television
    program and confirmed that the virus is transmissible between humans (National
    Health Commission, 2020). A group of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
    scientists  published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine on January
    29, 2020 concluding that “human-to-human transmission among close contacts has
    occurred since the middle of December and spread out gradually within a month
    after that” (Li et. al., 2020).\n\nCensoring virus-related messages in late December
    and early January may have put countless Chinese people unknowingly at risk of
    \ infection, depriving them of receiving early warning from media and  social
    media about the highly transmissible disease (Fu and Zhu, 2020). The censorship
    and information control may have also delayed the general public’s response to
    make necessary and timely protective measures. \n\n### How does China control
    information in general?\n\nInternet and digital technology have been profoundly
    shaping China’s social, economic, and even political domains. Even though the
    Internet is known to serve as an enabler for citizen activism in China, the state’s
    repressive power is remarkably strengthened by means of digital technologies<sup><a
    id=\"fnref3\" href=\"#fn3\">[3]</a></sup>. To illustrate this, for instance, three
    hundred million cameras will be reportedly installed in China for the purposes
    of surveillance and the devices are backed with facial and video recognition technologies.
    Chinese authorities have strongly emphasized the concept of cyber sovereignty,
    which broadly extends the notion of cyber security as a justification to control
    certain online activities which could be viewed as a threat to the state’s stability
    (Lee, 2018). Against this backdrop, China has introduced a sophisticated system
    to regulate traditional and online media and the system has been integrated into
    all Internet platforms. \n\nThe Chinese government has built the “Great Firewall”
    – a collective term to describe a large and sophisticated Internet filtering system
    and digital governance framework. These stringent measures make the Chinese Internet
    virtually an intranet, in which sensitive private and public communication are
    filtered, and access to foreign sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are
    blocked. Having said that, these practices are only part of the country’s censorship
    system. A major part of the content censorship is implemented by domestic Internet
    content providers. To comply with their license conditions, Chinese Internet service
    providers must act as censors to screen customer’s messages or disable accounts,
    which are executed by the company’s internal department or outsourced to external
    operators. \n\nChinese citizens also overly rely on local media, which are mostly
    state-owned, in order to receive information about COVID-19. International media
    or foreign social media sites are not accessible and posts circulating foreign
    media are also censored. For example, our system records a censored post on January
    18, which is attached with a screen capture of a coronavirus story titled “Four
    new confirmed cases in Wuhan; Estimated over 1,700 cases, according to expert”
    from the Hong Kong based media outlet, Radio and Television Hong Kong. Another
    Weibo message titled “Express: Suspected cases with unknown pneumonia found in
    South Korea,” which was hyperlinked to a story of the Yonhap News Agency on January
    8, 2020, was detected to be censored. \n\nChina’s real name registration policy
    requires Internet  users to disclose one’s real identity. The policy was officially
    launched on March 16, 2012. Registered users must release their identity numbers
    or indirect identifiers — such as mobile phone numbers — to service providers
    for government verification. Users can then choose to post either by nickname
    or real name; unregistered users can view posts, but can’t create content. Much
    concern has been raised that the true identity disclosure policy has imposed a
    chilling effect on online comments, especially on political criticism and other
    sensitive topics (Fu et al., 2013). Recently, the Chinese government reportedly
    requested new mobile phone users to receive facial scans. Online anonymity is
    virtually impossible in China. Surveillance cameras, facial recognition technology,
    and identity tracking have been extensively used to assist the authority’s public
    monitoring of the implementation of self-quarantine policy during the coronavirus
    outbreak<sup><a id=\"fnref5\" href=\"#fn5\">[5]</a></sup>.\n\nChina has introduced
    the Cybersecurity Law, which came into effect on June 1, 2017, and has created
    substantial market uncertainty<sup><a id=\"fnref6\" href=\"#fn6\">[6]</a></sup>.
    Public and private communication are closely monitored by service providers or/and
    the authorities. If a content crosses a “red line” (an often invisible, unknown
    yardstick) it may be censored, or the account owner’s content administrator may
    be invited to “drink tea”<sup><a id=\"fnref7\" href=\"#fn7\">[7]</a></sup>, requested
    to remove it. If an account is repeatedly found to be non-compliant with content
    regulations, it can be suspended or even permanently terminated<sup><a id=\"fnref8\"
    href=\"#fn8\">[8]</a></sup>. For certain serious offences, the content author

    \n\n### Impact beyond China’s borders\n\nWith China’s economic rise and growing
    global influence, the country has modernized its information systems and cyber
    warfare capabilities. Being the second largest economy in the world, information
    technology is not only key to both economic growth and the vital functions of
    society in China, but also national security. China now operates the most sophisticated
    online censorship system in the world, with over 854 million online citizens under
    its sphere (CNNIC, 2019). Apart from traditional warfare methods such as land,
    sea, air, and outer space, the online cyberspace has become a highly recognized
    domain of warfare to the Chinese government (Fritz, 2017). As China increases
    its engagement with the world, this struggle for controlling the narrative about
    the Chinese Communist Party and the country has expanded to global public opinion,
    an ambitious external propaganda project (Tsai, 2017), and the Internet is one
    of the latest battlespaces via the means of information warfare.\n\nApart from
    traditional forms of propaganda published on Chinese state media, there are now
    cases of organized and coordinated efforts of online influence campaigns on issues
    deemed of core interest and importance to the Chinese government, such as the
    detentions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the Taiwanese presidential elections, and the
    more recent Hong Kong protests (Mazarr et al., 2019).\n\nIn 2016, in wake of Taiwan
    President Tsai Ing-wen’s presidential election, over 27,000 comments flooded her
    Facebook page, mostly stating that Taiwan is a part of China. Since access to
    Facebook in Mainland China is blocked by the Great Firewall maintained by the
    state, the flood of comments were known as part of an organized campaign from
    an Internet forum called “Diba,” where forum users ironically scaled the Great
    Firewall to post nationalistic messages adhering to the official line of the Chinese
    Communist Party on Tsai’s Facebook posts (Yang & Chen, 2017).\n\nDiba users have
    since attempted but failed to influence the narrative on the Hong Kong protests
    in 2019 as well by trying to infiltrate LIHKG, a local reddit-like online forum
    frequently used by protesters in Hong Kong. Although no direct connection between
    the Diba users and the Chinese state were identified, concern has been raised
    towards a growing trend of either a grassroots level or organized “cyber-nationalism”
    by younger Chinese Internet users to influence the narrative on topics deemed
    of strategic value to the Chinese government (Fang & Repnikova, 2018). \n\nSocial
    media sites from the Western world have also acted on what they believe is a coordinated
    effort by the Chinese government to influence global narrative on China related
    topics, such as the Hong Kong protests. In August 2019, China’s information operations
    were brought to the light after several social media platforms, including Twitter
    and Facebook, discovered the existence of coordinated network activities by China
    that were spreading disinformation about Hong Kong protests. Twitter said that
    the aim of these operations was to undermine the protest movement’s “legitimacy
    and political positions.<sup><a id=\"fnref15\" href=\"#fn15\">[15]</a></sup>”\n\nAt
    the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic is still developing, and the crisis
    changes daily, but it seems apparent that the world after COVID-19 will look different.
    Relationships between China and the world are anticipated to become bitter and
    more contentious. China’s strategy to control information and its consequences
    has become a global concern. A lawsuit was launched to sue China for economic
    losses<sup><a id=\"fnref16\" href=\"#fn16\">[16]</a></sup> and an independent
    investigation into China’s information transparency and the virus origin was suggested.
    Further development remains an open question."

  body: "BOOM is an India-based fact checking organization that began actively debunking
    fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic since January 25, 2020, one week after China
    declared the spread of the virus. In an [analysis](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-file/fake-news-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-a-boom-study-8008)
    of around 178 fact checks that were purely related to COVID-19 information between
    January to May 2020, we found evidence of a phased ‘misinfodemic’ of misinformation
    spreading across online platforms in India. We found that COVID-19 misinformation
    increased in the month of March as the number of COVID-19 cases increased in the
    country. In this period, COVID-19 dominated the news cycle which also contributed
    to the increase in misinformation about the disease. While in February, BOOM fact-checked
    13 misinformation pieces about COVID-19, in March, this number had increased to
    69 articles. \n\nMost of the false or misleading claims we found were circulated
    with videos (35%). There was also a significant number of text messages (29.4%)
    being shared with fake cures, treatments or quotes from celebrities, along with
    images (29.4%) that were either misrepresented or doctored. We also noticed a
    small number of audio clips (2.2%) going viral with false context.  \n\nOur investigation
    classifies two waves of COVID-19 misinformation on social platforms such as WhatsApp,
    Facebook, Twitter – medical and communal. Medical misinformation that we found
    focused on theemergence, origin, spread, and cures of the virus. Communal misinformation
    emerged as the number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 increased, and
    the disease spread across the country. This type of misinformation leaned on and
    exacerbated existing tensions in the country, particularly long-standing rifts
    between the country’s Muslim minority and Hindu populations. Misinformation during
    this wave took on narratives related to the economy, politics, and local communities.\n\nIn
    both forms, COVID-19 misinformation on social media paints a picture of a changing
    pattern of news consumption, suggesting that the area may be an important topic
    for future research [(](https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2019/194/)[Li et al](https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2019/194/),
    2019). According to a 2018 Weber Shandwick [study](https://www.webershandwick.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Healthcare-Info-Search-Report.pdf)
    about The Great American Search for Healthcare Information, a study of 1700 individuals,
    around 73% of Americans gathered their healthcare information from the internet.
    There is no Indian study highlighting the sources of health information for Indians.
    \ \n\nIn India, in some cities like Mumbai, the police force enforced [strict
    action for peddlers](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/mumbai-police-warns-whatsapp-group-admins-over-covid-related-fake-news-11590374904713.html)
    of fake news and misinformation. Recent media reports suggest that Facebook and
    WhatsApp have been [taking active steps](https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/working-to-stop-misinformation-and-false-news)
    to curb the spread of misinformation on their websites. Research should be carried
    out to further understand how social media itself could be used to contain the
    spread of misinformation.This report outlines two distinct types of misinformation
    which we observed throughout the COVID-19 crisis in India between January to April
    2020.\n\n### Wave One: Medical Misinformation\n\n*India reported its first three
    cases of COVID-19 between the last week of January 2020 and the first week of
    February 2020. According to our analysis, this is also when the first wave of
    misinformation emerged in the country. Misinformation during this period was largely
    related to the science, spread, cause and conspiracy theories about the virus.
    Then, throughout February, India did not report any new cases. Our analysis found
    that during this time, there was a rise in misinformation about videos from China,
    being shared with misleading narratives. During this time, [a video of three events](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/video-shows-chinese-policemen-killing-coronavirus-patients-factcheck-6885)
    not related to COVID-19 was passed off as police brutality on COVID-19 patients
    in China. On March 2, 2020, India reported new cases as Indians returned home
    from countries in Europe and Asia.  With the emergence of new cases, misinformation
    on the prevention, control and cure of the virus, such as the use of home remedies
    not backed by science, like [drinking garlic water](https://www.boomlive.in/health/boiled-garlic-water-for-treating-coronavirus-not-really-6737)
    to prevent COVID-19, began to circulate again.*\n\nIndia’s first wave of misinformation
    revolved around the **origin, causes, spread, and treatment of the virus** and
    also **China’s response to controlling the outbreak**. In the early months of
    the pandemic the origin of the virus, and its modes of transmission, were unclear
    to scientists and the public alike. Conspiracy theories emerged on Indian social
    media, even though the virus was not yet present in the country. False claims
    about the virus originating in various animals, without any scientific evidence,
    circulated on platforms. Scientific progress on human to human transmission led
    to further speculations about the virus, such as false claims about the virus
    being a bioweapon, [manufactured in a lab](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-file/is-coronavirus-a-bioweapon-the-internet-loves-to-think-so-7623).
    \ \n\nThe origin of the virus was, and still is, mired in misinformation about
    it having emerged from a lab in Wuhan, of the virus already being [patented](https://www.boomlive.in/health/coronavirus-patented-why-social-media-posts-are-misleading-6661),
    of the virus being a bioweapon, all without any proof or credible evidence. In
    one misleading account, a false message which announced that COVID-19 is a Chinese
    conspiracy was attributed to somebody pretending to be a Chinese[intelligence
    officer](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-chinese-intelligence-officer-reveals-coronavirus-is-a-bioweapon-7224).
    However, this turned out to be a fictional story on social news platform  Reddit.
    The thread asked users to write a fictional story related to a real life event.\n\nFalse
    conspiracy theories circulated around China killing [20,000 patients](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-china-seeks-court-approval-to-kill-over-20000-coronavirus-patients-6812)
    to underreport the cases of COVID-19 in the country—misinformation that emerged
    from a web article on AB-TC, also known as City News, a regular fake news peddler.
    Other theories, such that [Dettol,](https://www.boomlive.in/health/did-dettol-know-about-coronavirus-outbreak-beforehand-a-factcheck-6767)
    many [books](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/did-these-books-predict-the-coronavirus-outbreak),
    the [Simpsons and Asterix](https://www.boomlive.in/health/did-the-simpsons-and-comic-series-asterix-predict-the-2019-coronavirus-outbreak-6867)
    predicted or already knew about the virus, have been rampantly circulating on
    social media. F[alse information](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/bat-infestation-video-from-florida-falsely-shared-as-coronavirus-source-found-6747)
    also circulated about [bats](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/fake-news-site-invents-story-about-covid-19-patient-zero-having-sex-with-bats-7407),
    [chicken](https://www.boomlive.in/health/false-coronavirus-found-in-broiler-chickens-6757),
    and [goats](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/old-video-shared-as-goats-infected-with-covid-19-in-ajmer-7265),
    as misleading origins of the virus have been circulating on social media. Other
    misinformation speculated that [5G Technology](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-file/did-the-race-to-5g-cause-the-coronavirus-outbreak-7404)could
    have led to emergence of the virus. All of these claims have been debunked by
    BOOM and other fact-checking organizations.\n\n**Fake notifications** attributed
    to various organizations also emerged as a norm during the first wave. Claims
    about the causes, spread, cure, and treatment of COVID-19 that were not supported
    by research were attributed to national and international organizations.Fake notifications
    attributed to [UNICEF](https://www.boomlive.in/health/viral-coronavirus-advisory-is-not-from-unicef-7171)
    and the Ministry of Health about ways [to prevent the virus](https://www.boomlive.in/health/hoax-alert-viral-emergency-notification-on-coronavirus-is-fake-6682)
    and not purchase colours from China during [Holi](about:blank), the festival of
    colours in India, emerged on social media. \n\n**Videos and narratives from China**
    with unreliable claims were scattered across social media. These claims focused
    on China’s surveillance tactics, atrocities that residents faced, strict authoritative
    action, and even false narratives related to the heads of the country. [Mock drills](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/coronavirus-mock-drill-by-chinese-police-viral-as-real-6997)
    across China were shared as police atrocities, a group of unrelated videos were
    combined to [showcase](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/video-shows-chinese-policemen-killing-coronavirus-patients-factcheck-6885)
    Chinese officials killing coronavirus patients. Along with this, an [Indonesian](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/coronavirus-indonesian-market-video-viral-as-wuhan-china-6697)
    wet animal market was shared as a Chinese market suggesting that China is not
    mending its ways. \n\nThe Chinese Prime Minister and President were not spared
    either. The [Chinese President](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/old-photos-of-xi-jinpings-mosque-visit-falsely-linked-to-coronavirus-6803)
    and [PM’](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/no-the-chinese-pm-did-not-visit-a-mosque-to-protect-himself-from-coronavirus-6763)s
    earlier visits to mosques were shared with narratives that the officials were
    visiting the mosques to improve China’s prevailing conditions.\n\nMoreover, as
    the symptoms of the virus were similar in nature to colds, social media was rife
    with different ways that the virus could have be cured or treated; false and unproven
    information about avoiding [cold food](https://www.boomlive.in/health/can-avoiding-ice-creams-and-cold-drinks-for-90-days-prevent-coronavirus-6689),
    drinking hot water, homeopathic tablets for prophylaxis to the consumption of
    anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine were shared online as preventive mechanisms.
    Claims about [homeopathic medicine](https://www.boomlive.in/health/does-homeopathic-medicine-arsenicum-album-30-prevent-coronavirus-a-fact-check-7156),
    home remedies such as various types of [tea](https://www.boomlive.in/coronavirus-outbreak/false-different-types-of-tea-can-act-as-a-cure-for-covid-19-7506),
    [garlic](https://www.boomlive.in/health/boiled-garlic-water-for-treating-coronavirus-not-really-6737)
    and hot water as well as [cow urine](https://www.boomlive.in/factcheck/can-cow-urine-or-gaumutra-cure-coronavirus-what-we-know-7308)
    curing COVID-19 circulated in the country. [Alcohol](https://www.boomlive.in/health/does-drinking-alcohol-prevent-coronavirus-6935)
    and [marijuana](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/marijuana-kills-coronavirus-meme-viral-with-false-claims-6831)
    were also shared as plausible cures for coronavirus. Along with this, there were
    also many [speculations](about:blank) about [vaccines](https://www.boomlive.in/health/viral-posts-claiming-vaccines-for-coronavirus-have-been-developed-are-false-7201)
    for the virus before the actual trial of vaccines had begun. \n\nAfter reporting
    three cases in February 2020 India did not report any new cases until March 2,
    2020. During this period, we observed misinformation decreasing in volume, picking
    up again in early March when new international hotspots began emerging.\n\n###
    Wave Two: Communal Misinformation\n\n*In March, an Islamic congregation held in
    New Delhi changed the trajectory of the misinformation universe in India. The
    Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary movement, held an annual gathering with international
    attendees. The convening later emerged as a hotspot of COVID-19 cases. As cases
    increased steadily, misinformation about religion and politics started circulating
    more prominently in the country. The Indian Prime Minister,  Narendra Modi, along
    with enforcing a lockdown in the country for 21 days and further extending it
    twice, also assigned activities for expressing gratitude to all the frontline
    workers in the country. Misinformation emerged around the [banging of plates](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/how-celebs-amplified-misinformation-around-janta-curfew-7317)
    and [lighting of diyas](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-photo-shows-india-illuminated-during-pm-modis-9-pm-9-minutes-appeal-7562)
    or earthen lamps, tasks requested by the Prime Minister.*\n\n*India is currently
    amidst the second wave of misinformation that is an amalgamation of the pre-existing
    first wave and themes of economic, administrative, communal, and lockdown related
    misinformation. The older themes of origin, prevention, cure, and treatment continued
    to be in circulation. The second wave appears to be circulated more widely with
    a higher consumption rate on social media as it even takes into consideration
    the effect that the virus has upon sectors other than health.* \n\nThe second
    wave of misinformation in India is thematically about politics, religion, culture,
    and economics—which we define as communal misinformation. Misinformation with
    communal narratives, along with narratives around the lockdown, emerged to be
    the biggest contributor to misinformation during the second wave of misinformation.
    BOOM fact-checked 34 claims with communal narratives in this period. \n\nThe second
    wave of misinformation picked up pace when the Indian Prime Minister addressed
    the country for the first time on March 18, 2020. As an expression of gratitude
    for the frontline workers and to understand the importance of social distancing,
    he announced March 22 as Janata curfew, a self-imposed curfew, wherein he requested
    citizens to stay at home for that day and at 5 PM clap or play an instrument from
    the confines of their homes for frontline workers. Following this event, another
    task of lighting diyas, the 21-day lockdown and the subsequent 18-day lockdown
    followed. Fake news related to the lockdown, and the two gratitude events spread
    across the country along with hailing the PM. This included celebrities who shared
    the Prime Minister’s request for expressing gratitude with false narratives. One
    of the most viral pieces of misinformation was about the banging of plates killing
    the virus as misinformation on the virus’ shelf life on [surfaces](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-file/message-claiming-coronavirus-lives-on-a-surface-for-12-hours-is-misleading-7310)
    and [air](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/message-claiming-coronavirus-can-last-up-to-8-hours-in-air-is-misleading-7328)
    circulated with many different claims. \n\nClaims about the virus lasting on surfaces
    for various hours and it spreading through [currency](https://www.boomlive.in/health/can-contaminated-currencies-spread-coronavirus-all-you-need-to-know-7297)
    were rife on social media. Images depicting [money](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/did-italians-throw-their-money-on-the-streets-due-to-covid-19-deaths-7468)
    lying strewn over streets due to it being a transmission method were circulating
    on social media. Another piece suggesting [Narendra Modi](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-us-uk-asked-pm-modi-to-lead-18-nation-coronavirus-task-force-7475)
    was appointed as the leader of a special task force to tackle COVID-19 has also
    been doing the rounds. \n\nThe Indian administrative authorities were also targeted
    with misinformation as Indian social media was flooded with messages suggesting
    that the [Tourism Ministry](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-tourism-ministry-announces-closure-of-hotels-till-october-15-7645)
    was keeping all hotels and restaurants shut in lieu of the coronavirus. Other
    messages of the [Supreme Court](about:blank) banning Indian media houses from
    publishing Coronavirus news reports were also doing the rounds. The [Mumbai police](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/mumbai-police-call-out-whatsapp-audio-clips-going-viral-in-its-name-7451)
    also debunked a couple of videos which were repeatedly shared in its name. \n\nAnother
    piece of misinformation which was a notification that falsely attributed a Cambridge
    study to the [WHO](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/viral-messages-stating-who-protocols-for-lockdown-extension-are-false-7552)
    stating it had proposed a lockdown schedule to fight the virus was shared widely
    in the country.\n\nMany esteemed industrialists and doctors of the country have
    been dragged into the fake news surrounding coronavirus. Images and audio files
    bearing fake quotes related to India’s battle with COVID-19 have been misattributed
    to doctors like [Dr. Devi Shetty](https://www.boomlive.in/coronavirus-outbreak/dr-devi-shetty-did-not-record-viral-audio-clip-on-coronavirus-7275)_,_
    \ the founder of Narayana Hrudyalaya, a chain of hospitals in India and other
    influential celebrities such as [Ratan Tata](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/ratan-tata-quote-on-impact-of-coronavirus-on-indian-economy-is-fake-7634),
    the chairman of Tata Group of Companies and [Raghuram Rajan](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/raghuram-rajan-did-not-address-imf-webinar-on-covid-19-7767),
    the ex-governor of the Reserve Bank of India. \n\nThe communal and religious misinformation
    wave began when an Islamic congregation in Delhi came under the line of fire after
    many people who attended the event tested positive which led to a spurt of cases
    in India. Older videos of communal violence, incidences from other countries being
    shared as communal differences in India, videos of spitting in food, coughing
    in food shared falsely as Muslims deliberately trying to spread the virus in India
    gained momentum as soon as news about this congregation were shared across the
    country. \n\nAudio stating that Muslim [vendors](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/viral-audio-clip-claiming-muslim-vendors-in-surat-are-spreading-coronavirus-is-false-7644)
    were spreading coronavirus in Surat, [Jamaat attendees](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-markaz-attendee-thrashed-by-cops-for-misbehaving-with-hospital-staff-7647)
    were claimed to be harassed and beaten by the police, while a video of a [pharmacist](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-communal-spin-given-to-madhya-pradesh-pharmacists-death-7611)’s
    death was shared with a communal spin. Along with this, a gathering of migrant
    workers in [Mumbai](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/migrants-defying-lockdown-at-mumbais-bandra-station-given-communal-spin-7683)
    was given a communal spin suggesting Muslims were trying to defy the lockdown
    and spread coronavirus. Claims from [Haldwani](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/rumours-led-to-residents-protest-against-imams-quarantine-uttarakhand-police-7680)
    suggested that Muslims were purportedly defying the lockdown to spread coronavirus.
    \n\nIt is pertinent to understand the nature of India’s religious and communal
    narratives to gauge why the Muslim community was particularly targeted as a vector
    to spread misinformation. In the last three decades, the country has witnessed
    many incidences of Hindu- Muslim rivalry. From the demolition of the Babri Masjid
    in 1992 and the subsequent riots and bomb blasts across the country to the recent
    attack on students at Jamia Milia University in Delhi for the much touted National
    Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizen Amendment Act which was felt to be
    discriminatory against the community, the recent coronavirus misinformation augments
    the communal bias in the country. \n\nThe pre-existing themes of the first wave
    of misinformation have passed on to the second wave too. The claim that nigella
    seeds possess [hydroxychloroquine](https://www.boomlive.in/coronavirus-outbreak/hydroxychloroquine-found-in-kalonji-seeds-not-quite-7631)
    – a drug that is undertrial as a potential cure for COVID-19- was not scientifically
    backed. Claims that [thrombosis](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/is-thrombosis-the-leading-cause-of-covid-19-deaths-a-factcheck-7977)-
    blood clots are the leading reason for Coronavirus deaths instead of respiratory
    failure were also circulating during this period. \n\nVideos with false narratives
    are continuously in circulation. Old videos of people [committing suicide](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/2015-video-from-philadelphia-peddled-as-coronavirus-suicide-in-italy-7620)
    in two separate instances were passed off as people [committing suicide](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/dated-photos-of-a-suicide-in-spain-falsely-linked-to-coronavirus-in-italy-7370)
    due to coronavirus. A [lion](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/putin-let-loose-lions-to-keep-russians-indoors-bizarre-claim-goes-viral-7320)
    on the streets of South Africa was shared as Russia’s efforts to maintain a lockdown.
    A video of a woman in the hospital was claimed to be [Sophie Trudeau](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/no-this-is-not-sophie-trudeau-talking-about-coronavirus-7299)\n\nFurthermore,
    casualties in an earthquake in [Croatia](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/croatia-earthquake-pics-peddled-as-italy-overwhelmed-with-covid-19-patients-7363)
    were peddled as Italy’s deteriorating condition. Body bags from Ecuador were shared
    as [New York](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/no-this-video-does-not-show-body-bags-in-a-new-york-hospital-7588),
    Pakistani videos of [apple](https://www.boomlive.in/fast-check/video-of-boy-washing-apples-in-a-sewer-in-pakistan-revived-7605)
    washing and [quarantine centres](https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/video-of-an-agitated-woman-at-a-quarantine-centre-in-pakistan-shared-as-india-7661)
    were circulating as India.\n\nIndia is currently not only battling COVID-19 and
    health misinformation but also is tackling many different narratives of misinformation.

  body: "Shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the Philippines, a volcano
    about 31 miles south of Manila erupted on a quiet Sunday afternoon in January
    2020, after 47 years of fitful rest. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
    Seismology (Phivolcs) immediately raised risk levels and informed the public of
    a moderate level of volcanic activity. When the volcano’s ash explosions became
    stronger, the organization warned “of imminent hazardous eruption.” The government
    immediately undertook forced evacuation of thousands of families from the volcano
    island and villages surrounding Taal lake, as it declared those ashfall-covered
    areas surrounding the volcano as no man’s land.\n\nDuring the emergency, scientists
    at Phivolcs were near precise with their news bulletins and firm with warnings,
    even when some residents and local government officials complained of the restrictions
    imposed. Philvolcs [did not lack defenders](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/21/20/sila-ang-dalubhasa-govt-execs-defend-phivolcs-after-vice-mayors-tirade)
    when a [popular broadcaster](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-mon-tulfo-falsely-claims-phivolcs-fail)
    and some lawmakers[ accused](about:blank) the agency of failing to warn the public
    about Taal volcano’s eruption. In general, the emergency science communication
    following the eruption of the volcano was hailed as a swift success. \n\nIt was
    on the heels of the volcanic crisis that COVID-19 made its way to the Philippines—a
    disaster for which communication was not nearly as smooth.\n\nThe month-long eruption
    of the Taal volcano affected more than [500,000](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1093705)
    people in four provinces, and killed 39 people, but had “[minimal](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1091423),”
    effect on the national economy. It is not generally comparable to the magnitude
    of the calamity that the COVID-19 pandemic has so far caused, which [economists
    estimate](https://www.bworldonline.com/impact-of-covid-19-on-key-philippine-economic-sectors/)
    to reach P276.3 billion (US$5.5 billion) to P2.5 trillion (US$50.2 billion). However,
    crisis communications amongst leadership may be one element through which the
    two deadly events can be compared. \n\nPhilippine health officials went through
    anger, frustration and distrust from the public before their pandemic efforts
    were appreciated. So far, the virus has afflicted more than 70,000 people and
    claimed the lives of at least 1,800 others as of July 22, 2020 in the country.\n\nThe
    tide of public sentiment turned for the national Department of Health (DOH) when
    it decided to put competent officials untainted by politics on the front line,
    like Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, the spokesperson for COVID-19
    related matters.\n\nRegardless, newly-gained public trust enjoyed by DOH still
    does not extend to the head of the office health chief, Secretary Francisco Duque
    III, whose [resignation](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/16/20/senators-demand-duques-resignation-as-health-chief-over-coronavirus-crisis)
    was demanded by a majority of senators. Nor does it include President Rodrigo
    Duterte, whose [midnight briefings](https://opinion.inquirer.net/128693/duterte-is-the-weakest-link)
    on COVID-19 have become a source of annoyance, confusion and information disorder.\n\nDuque,
    an immunologist and pathologist and a graduate of Harvard School of Public Health,
    presided over the 2009 H1N1 outbreak during his first stint as health secretary.
    Despite his experience, the country’s top public health authority [dilly-dallied](https://malaya.com.ph/index/index.php/news_opinion/crowning-glory/)
    on crucial issues related to COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. Appearing
    in a Jan. 29 hearing on COVID-19, called by the House of Representatives, Duque
    towed the line of President Duterte, that there was no need to impose a travel
    ban to and from China, not even to and from the province of Hubei where Wuhan,
    the first epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease outbreak, is located.\n\n“If
    we do this, then the concerned country, China in this case, might question why
    we’re not doing this for all the other countries that have reported confirmed
    cases of the [COVID-19],” Duque said. Critics said a health secretary should only
    be concerned about health matters, and should leave the business of diplomatic
    relations to the foreign secretary. Duque got an unlikely defender in the person
    of a Duterte critic, Sen. Leila de Lima, who is currently detained on allegations
    of drug trafficking. De Lima said the health secretary is merely [implementing
    a policy](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1260791/blame-duterte-not-duque-for-gross-negligence-in-covid-19-response#ixzz6SneCeS6O)
    set by the President.\n\nRelations between the Philippines and China [elicit intense
    sentiments](https://www.sws.org.ph/swsmain/artcldisppage/?artcsyscode=ART-20190405180119)
    among Filipinos, because the two countries are embroiled in a territorial dispute
    over islands in the South China Sea. The Philippines has won the case in the Permanent
    Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2016, but the Duterte government decided
    to set aside the legal victory in favor of closer relations with the economic
    superpower, which has built artificial islands turned military garrisons in the
    disputed maritime area. Filipinos also resent the influx of Chinese working in
    online gaming in the country that, although it has boosted the real estate industry,
    [ has spawned ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/philippines-gambling-chinese-syndicates-linked-crime-surge-200305180334678.html)criminal
    activities including corruption, prostitution and murders.\n\nEventually, the
    government imposed a COVID-19 travel ban which many saw as superfluous, because
    by that time, Hubei was already on lockdown. Duterte extended the travel ban to
    cover any person traveling directly from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, with the
    exception of Filipinos and holders of permanent resident visas. Later, he included
    Taiwan in the travel ban following the country’s One- China policy that considers
    the island state a province of China. It was lifted after a few days following
    a protest from Taiwan and uproar from the 160,000 Filipino workers there.\n\n###
    Face Masks\n\nConflicting statements and actions by government officials about
    face masks confused the public even further. On January 12, at around the same
    time that the world was being alerted about the outbreak of a “mystery virus”
    in Wuhan, the Taal Volcano erupted, spewing ashes that covered surrounding communities.
    The eruption resulted in a high demand for protective masks, which continued to
    be a valued commodity after the volcano’s alert level was lowered, and as the
    threat of the COVID-19 grew. \n\nOn Feb. 5 the third COVID-19 case in the country
    was [confirmed](https://www.doh.gov.ph/doh-press-release/doh-confirms-3rd-2019-nCoV-ARD-case-in-PH)
    to be a 60-year-old woman who came from Wuhan, China. The Land Transportation
    Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the government agency which manages
    operations of public utility vehicles in the country, issued a [memorandum](http://ltfrb.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MC-2020-005.pdf)
    ordering all public utility drivers and conductors “to properly wear face masks
    at all times while on duty.” Noncompliance would [cause](https://www.doh.gov.ph/node/19359)
    them a penalty fee of P5,000 for breach of franchise regulations. Three days later
    the Health Department issued an [advisory](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/02/11/doh-nods-rule-requiring-puv-drivers-to-wear-masks-says-its-prudent/?)
    clarifying that “people in good health” need not use face masks. Individuals who
    are sick, or those who usually come in close contact with the sick, are the only
    ones recommended to use masks. The DOH later [acknowledged](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/02/11/doh-nods-rule-requiring-puv-drivers-to-wear-masks-says-its-prudent/?)
    “it might be prudent for drivers to use a mask” since they are exposed to a lot
    of people daily.” \n\nA Manila city official was seen incorrectly [demonstrating](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-manila-vice-mayor-lacuna-demos-wrong-w),
    during a televised press conference, the right way to wear a face mask. Manila
    Vice Mayor Sheila \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, a former physician at the Manila health
    office, told the public that when one is sick, one should wear the white part
    on the inside because the white side prevents or blocks the bacteria, and the
    blue side should be outside. The WHO, however, said there is only one proper way
    to wear surgical masks: the colored side is out. The video of that press conference
    has been taken down online.\n\nThis confusion and diminished credibility in authorities
    fueled rumors and speculations about public health precautions. A Jan. 22 post
    by a Facebook user, for example, claimed that the dreaded virus was already in
    the popular island resort of Boracay, in the southern part of the Philippines.
    The [post, which VERA Files](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-duterte-did-not-open-pgh-wuhan-covid-1)
    tagged as “False” was shared 5,600 times in just a few days. It was easy for the
    Boracay story to be believed because alarm was raised about the large number of
    tourist arrivals from Wuhan in time for the Jan. 25 Chinese New Year, before a
    lock down on the COVID-19 epicenter was imposed.\n\nRiding on Duterte’s pro-China
    policy, [a false report](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-online-posts-claiming-novel-coronaviru)
    by the website City News (ab-tc.com) claimed that the President ordered the Philippine
    General Hospital (PGH) to accept COVID-19 patients from Wuhan. The post, showing
    an April 2019 Reuters photo of Duterte with Chinese President Xi Jinping, was
    shared by pro-Duterte groups and, using an app that measures potential reach of
    a certain post,  could have reached 94,000 Facebook users.The panic that the misinformation
    created among the population resulted in cancellation of classes, conferences,
    cultural performances and pop concerts long before a Luzon-wide lockdown was imposed.\n\n###
    Press freedom: A casualty in a national emergency situation\n\nOn March 16 the
    Philippines had registered two deaths from COVID-19 infection and the confirmed
    infections increased to more than 40. President Duterte declared a nationwide
    state of calamity, to facilitate response and the release of funds to combat the
    fast-spreading virus.\n\nEnhanced Community Quarantine was imposed throughout
    Luzon, the largest and most populous island in the country, including Metro Manila.
    Duterte called on the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine
    National Police (PNP) to lead in the implementation of the quarantine guidelines.\n\nOn
    March 23, Philippine Congress passed a law ([Republic Act No. 11469)](https://www.senate.gov.ph/Bayanihan-to-Heal-as-One-Act-RA-11469.pdf)
    giving the President “powers that are necessary and proper to carry out the declared
    national policy.” Punishable acts enumerated in the law, which is known as “Bayanihan
    to Heal as One Act,” include:\n\n> Individual or groups creating, perpetrating,
    or spreading false information regarding the Covid-19 crisis on social media and
    other platforms, such as information having no valid or beneficial effect on the
    population, and are clearly geared to promote chaos, panic, anarchy, fear, or
    confusion; and those participating in cyber incidents that make use or take advantage
    of the current crisis situation to prey on the public through scams, phishing,
    fraudulent emails, or other similar act.\n\nPress freedom advocates and groups
    [protested](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/731258/groups-question-anti-fake-news-provision-in-covid-19-response-bill/story/)
    the inclusion of that provision in the law. The National Union of Journalists
    in the Philippines (NUJP) said: “While we acknowledge the need to fight disinformation
    in this time of crisis, we fear the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act will only end
    up criminalizing free speech.”\n\n“In times of crisis, when the swift delivery
    of accurate information to our people is vital, we need more, not less, independent
    reporting,” NUJP added.\n\nNUJP’s concern is not without basis. [Human Rights
    Watch slammed](https://hronlineph.com/2020/04/23/statement-hrw-calls-for-release-of-cebu-writer-arrested-for-fb-post/)
    authorities for the arrest of Maria Victoria Beltran, an artist from Cebu City
    in southern Philippines for “misuse of the law” over a Facebook post which she
    said was actually a satire.\n\nOn May 3, Press Freedom Day, PNP-Anti-Crime Group,
    [in a press release](http://pnp.gov.ph/index.php/news-and-information/3682-32-persons-nabbed-for-fake-news-on-social-media-cops-with-covid-19-now-at-19),
    said 32 persons were arrested for “spreading fake news on social media portals
    that have caused panic among people.” It did not say what were the posts nor mention
    the names of those arrested.\n\nThe Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has reminded
    the government that public service requires a higher tolerance for opinions and
    criticisms, especially that a democracy works best when there are healthy discourses
    on governance; thereby, allowing greater accountability from our public officials.\n\n"

  body: "South Korea is lauded globally for its early and swift response to the COVID-19
    pandemic, but online and offline misinformation in some of the country’s religious
    groups played an outsize role in the spread of disease. The majority of South
    Korea’s “group infections”—which are defined as epidemics in specific areas, such
    as schools, companies, churches, or factories—originated in the country’s religious
    institutions. Churches [accounted for](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015)
    nearly 40 per cent of the country’s total cases  since Jan. 20, when the first
    confirmed case of the coronavirus came out. The most widely reported example of
    this phenomenon was the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, but misinformation amongst
    other religious leaders also contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
    This report is an effort to outline group infections in religious centers in South
    Korea, and analyze the role that misinformation played in how the virus spread
    amongst members of some of the country’s churches.\n\n### Shincheonji Church of
    Jesus\n\nOn February 18, 2020 a 61-year-old woman living in Daegu, South Korea
    was diagnosed as the country’s 31st COVID-19 patient. She was a member of the
    Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive Christian group in South Korea. Lee Man-Hee,
    the founder of the church, calls himself as the Messiah and has been [accused
    of brainwashing members](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html).
    Many South Koreans have called for the church to be disbanded, as it is widely
    perceived to be a cult. The 31st diagnosis in South Korea was a ‘super spreader’
    event, and it changed the trajectory of the disease in the country significantly.
    \ About [5,300 confirmed cases](https://www.lawtimes.co.kr/Legal-News/Legal-News-View?serial=162398)of
    COVID-19 in South Korea have now been linked by contact tracers to the Shincheonji
    Church, including direct and secondaryinfections. \n\nThe secretive operations
    of the Shincheonji Church means that members are not easy to identify. Accounts
    from a Shincheonji Church victim group reported that during the epidemic, the
    leader of the church texted church members’ cell phones, articulating that COVID-19
    was a “great disaster” predicted in the book of Revelation, and that church members
    should not worry about the virus. “He had misled his followers with such an absurd
    logic, saying that the Coronavirus was caused by demons, who saw the rapid growth
    of Shincheonji and tried to stop it,” said Yeon-ho Hong, former leader of the
    national coalition of Shincheonji victims. The church members, Yeon-ho described,
    would have to endure the virus and win the test. Members continued to worship
    in confined spaces in their churches, against government advice to halt mass gatherings.
    Yeon-ho said “church members were told not to be afraid of the illness.” Shincheonji’s
    spokespeople have articulated that the directives were never church policy, and
    that the church leaders are co-operating with the government.\n\nAccording to
    a [month-long investigation](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015)
    by the South Korean federal government and the City of Daegu, between February
    22nd to March 12th 2020 about 4,100 COVID-19 cases originated from the Daegu Shincheonji
    center. At that time, the country’s total confirmed cases sat at around [8,000](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015),
    according to Central Disease Control and Prevention Headquarters, making the church
    the origin of more than half the cases.\n\n### Eunhye River Church\n\nAt Eunhye
    River Church in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, seventy eight members were infected
    by the virus. Eunhye River Church leaders believed that [spraying salt water ](https://imnews.imbc.com/replay/2020/nwdesk/article/5673347_32524.html)in
    one’s mouth would prevent COVID-19. The false social media rumors online suggested
    that salt water would prevent coronavirus because of its antiseptic properties.
    \n\n“We strongly suspect that there was a confirmed case among the worshippers
    caused [by] salt water spray that was not disinfected. Sharing salt water spray
    [is] actually no different from direct [COVID-19] contact,” said Lee Hee-young,
    co-head of the Covid-19 emergency team in Gyeonggi Province. Closed circuit surveillance
    tape showed that the Eunhye River Church sprayed salt water [on] members, according
    an investigation by Ms. Hee-young’s team. She identified the spread of the misinformation
    as an ‘infodemic.’ \n\n\n### Manmin Central Church\n\nA ended up infecting a number
    of people in different workplaces, according to the [Korean ](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015)[CDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015).
    Another former pastor of Manmin Central church confirmed the church’s position
    on the virus, saying that “church members were told not to be afraid of the illness.”\n\n###
    General group transmission\n\nAt Bucheon Life Water church another 48 people were
    infected, 32 at the On-cheon Church in Dongnae-gu, Busan, 10 at Geochang Church
    in Gyeungnam Province, and nine at the Gyuamseong Church in Buyeo, South Chungcheong
    Province, according to the [Korean CDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015).
    In these cases, it remains unclear if misinformation played a role in the churchgoers
    gathering against government regulations, but what is known is that mass gatherings
    took place and many of these infections reverberated throughout the country. Based
    on the [Korean government’s contact tracing](https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/202003221339370665),
    a Eunhye Riber church member who was infected at church later infected his co-worker,
    who ended up infecting his wife.\n\nThe worst recorded case of the tertiary infection
    happened at a workplace of an infected Manmin Center church member. The church
    member’s workplace, a customer service call center, consists of multiple call
    booths in a cramped space and it created a cluster of infections [over 150 individuals](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200325128700017).
    Korea CDC diligently traced all contacts of the infected people and confirmed
    this cluster.\n\nTo be sure, many churches in South Korea took steps to bring
    worship services online following news of the coronavirus outbreak and as an added
    counter-measure the South Korean government created a plan to place public health
    officers at multi-use facilities such as religious facilities. The measures include
    no entry to the religious facilities without wearing a mask or multiple entrance
    check points for any symptoms before entering the facilities.\n\nCompared to other
    countries, the virus has been successfully fought from spreading, thanks to a
    massive amount of testing, contact tracing, and preemptive quarantine measures.
    The South Korean government lifted the restrictions and further opened the country
    on May 6,, including the opening of theaters, restaurants, and shopping malls.
    The government also provided detailed guidelines such as mandatory wearing of
    masks and daily indoor air ventilation. The South Korean citizens are eager to
    go back to their daily lives. \n\nTo counter such future infection clusters at
    churches, the Seoul Metropolitan Government filed a complaint against the Sarang
    First Church, which did not follow the city’s ban on large assemblies and had
    a mass Sunday worship on March 29th. Kim Kang-lip, general coordinator of the
    Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, said \"the spread of
    the Covid-19 is slowing down, but we should not let our guard down.\" He added
    \"we are fully informing each religious facility about the dangers. We are asking
    them to recognize the severity of the situation and to adopt preventive measures
    as much as possible.\"\n"

  body: "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro
    told the public, without evidence, that the now-disproven treatment hydroxychloroquine
    [could “cure COVID-19](https://br.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN249396)”. That misinformation,
    delivered definitively by the country’s leader, provoked the Brazlian public to
    try to [gain access to the medicine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/world/americas/virus-brazil-bolsonaro-chloroquine.html).
    People with critical diseases like lupus, who need the drug for scientifically-backed
    treatment purposes were hospitalized after being unable[ to access the medication](https://noticias.r7.com/saude/falta-de-cloroquina-causa-internacao-de-pacientes-com-lupus-08062020)
    due to hoarding by misinformed citizens. \n\nOn July 9, 2020 Bolsonaro appeared
    in public claiming he had contracted the disease, and said that he would take
    [hydroxychloroquine](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-does-the-scientific-literature-say-about-using-hydroxychloroquine-to-prevent-treat-or-cure-covid-19/)
    as a treatment. The president then falsely sold the medicine, again, as a \"savior.”
    When Bolsonaro’s Minister of Health Henrique Mandetta rejected [hydroxychloroquin](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-s-love-for-hydroxychloroquine-costs-brazil-another-health-minister/story-jkEFmRFR4sZYneLZxQjb1J.html)[e](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-s-love-for-hydroxychloroquine-costs-brazil-another-health-minister/story-jkEFmRFR4sZYneLZxQjb1J.html)
    as a drug for the virus, Bolsonaro replaced him with another Minister, who left
    the portfolio for similar reasons. \n\nThis is just one example of Brazilian president
    Jair Bolsonaro’s failings amid our current international crisis. He opposes national
    and international health agencies, hampers the actions of state governors and
    worries primarily about the economy, taking a strong stand against social isolation
    measures that seek to prevent the disease. The head of the nation recently told

    population, in turn, is left banging [pots on windows](https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/panelacos-em-capitais-expoem-desgaste-de-bolsonaro-apos-crise-do-coronavirus-24313870)
    in protest of their government. The country’s leadership is now considered one
    of the worst in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. Bolsonaro has also downplayed
    the severity of COVID-19, and questioned the work of scientific experts. When
    the number of deaths reached records of more than 1,000 a day, Bolsonaro doubted
    the case counts, and [removed months of data from an official website](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52952686).
    A [consortium of traditional Brazilian newspapers](https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/06/08/veiculos-de-comunicacao-formam-parceria-para-dar-transparencia-a-dados-de-covid-19.ghtml)
    formed to make the count independent of the national government through a task
    force that updated the statistics with the Brazilian state agencies. \n\nDébora
    D'Ávila, director of Scientific Dissemination at the University of Minas Gerais
    (UFMG), said, \"People cannot trust anything that he (Bolsonaro) talks about.
    His inconsistency ... the speech changes depending on the interest.”\n\nThese
    issues are exacerbated by an online environment in which governments compete with
    online content creators for the attention of their citizens. “We have influencers
    and Youtubers expressing their opinion, gaining attention that investigative journalists
    do not have,\" said Janine Miranda Cardoso, professor of the graduate program
    of ICICT - Institute of Communication and Scientific Information and Health Technology
    Foundation of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation[ (Fiocruz).](https://portal.fiocruz.br/)
    \"Combating misinformation is necessary, but insufficient. For an epidemic, the
    path is to strengthen health services, which are without resources,” Cardoso added.
    \n\nBolsonaro criticized the way state [governors](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/veja-o-que-bolsonaro-ja-disse-sobre-coronavirus-de-certa-histeria-a-fantasia-e-nerouse.shtml)
    reacted to the pandemic, saying the people were being deceived by them and the
    media. He spoke of allegedly excessive measures, which he called [\"hysteria,”
    that \"would hurt the economy.”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/veja-o-que-bolsonaro-ja-disse-sobre-coronavirus-de-certa-histeria-a-fantasia-e-nerouse.shtml)\n\nThe
    president’s response to COVID-19 impacts the entire global market. Brazil has
    the [ninth largest GDP in the world](https://www.mercadoeconsumo.com.br/2020/01/10/brasil-deve-ser-a-9a-maior-economia-do-mundo-no-fim-da-decada/),
    is the second largest producer of soybeans, is among the 30 countries that export
    the most products, standing out if beef, corn, oil. A stalled Brazillian economy
    will indeed have supply chain impacts far beyond its borders, but as the disease
    progresses in the country it has become clear that in the Bolsonaro administration,
    economic consequences take priority over the health of the population.\n\nBrazilians
    live feeling that they don’t know the real state of COVID-19 in their country,
    don’t know what information to trust, and aren’t sure that the country is taking
    all necessary measures to prevent and reduce damage."
