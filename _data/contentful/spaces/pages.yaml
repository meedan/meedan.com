  title: Code of Conduct
  slug: code-of-conduct
  body: "Meedan is committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and collaborative environment
    for all participants in events, regardless of their gender, gender expression,
    race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, physical
    appearance, disability, or age. We encourage every participant to be themselves,
    and must respect the rights of others.\nThe code of conduct is a set of guidelines
    that establishes shared values and ensures that behaviors that may harm participants
    are avoided.\n\nThe values of the Meedan community are focused on developing both
    our individual and collective potential, supporting and empowering the most marginalized,
    mutual respect, and an anti-violence approach that favors support and collaboration
    among participants and the resolution of conflicts.\n\nA code of conduct helps
    us co-exist in a more positive way, and provides individuals who are victims of
    negative behaviors with confidence that they will be supported by the organization
    and Meedan community, who respects and stands behind the code of conduct.\n\nMeedan
    works towards providing a welcoming environment where participants are treated
    with dignity and respect and are free to be themselves. We encourage all participants
    to approach the event with an open and positive attitude, engaging constructively
    with others at all times.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nBy attending a Meedan event
    or participating in Meedan forums, we all agree to the following code of conduct\n\n###
    Respect for Diversity & Inclusion\n\nWe avoid comments, actions or propaganda
    that encourages discrimination related to gender, gender expression, race, ethnicity,
    religion, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, physical appearance, disability,
    or age.\n\n### Respect Freedom of Expression\n\nWe support an individual's freedom
    of expression, and will not make fun of accents or make unsolicited grammatical
    corrections. We will strive to better understand each other by not assuming experiences
    or beliefs, clarifying meanings, and making an effort to speak clearly, avoiding
    jargon and acronyms.\n\n### Commitment to Non-Violence  \n\nWe will not engage
    in any type of violence or aggression, including verbal threats or complaints,
    intimidation, stalking or harassment, whether physically or psychologically.\n\nBe
    mindful of people who have experienced trauma. Let someone leave a conversation
    that makes them uncomfortable, and do not follow people who asked to be left alone.
    If you discuss difficult topics that may be traumatic for participants, provide
    warnings so people may leave a conversation or plan coping strategies. For content
    warnings:\n\nUse CW (content warning) at the beginning of your post or message,
    with a short description of the traumatic content. For example:\n\n- CW (content
    warning) for gender-based violence\n- CW (content warning) description of racist
    incident\n- CW (content warning) anxiety\n- CW (content warning) medical procedure\n\nOn
    Slack, write the content warning, then reply to your own message with the potentially
    traumatic content to create a thread. \n\nFor text-only messaging, provide the
    content warning and add several new lines before the potentially traumatizing
    content. \n\nThere are topics you may not realize need a content warning. If you
    are asked to provide a content warning and have questions, contact us for explanations
    instead of asking the traumatized person to teach you. Your moderation team is
    happy to provide guidance! \n\n### Rejection of Sexual Harassment  \n\nWe understand
    sexual harassment as unwanted physical contact or insinuation of a sexual nature,
    as well as displaying images, drawings or visual representations of any kind that
    objectify members of any gender or reinforce oppression. The only exception is
    if this is part of a session, workshop and/or educational experience where showing
    these images is educational in nature. \n\n### Respect for Privacy  \n\nWe safeguard
    the privacy of the participants, and agree to follow Meedan's privacy policy.
    This includes refraining from tweeting, posting, or publishing information about
    attendees (including names and affiliation) unless given clear permission, and
    avoid any type of unauthorized video, audio recording, or photography.\n\n###
    Facilitate Participation & Collaboration  \n\nWe work to create an environment
    that facilitates participation for all participants, and that session presenters
    are given respect. We will not engage in sustained disruption of sessions or events,
    interrupt conversations in a way that negatively impacts collaboration, or engage
    in toxic behaviors to attract negative attention to an attendee.\n\n### We Care
    about the Integrity and Health of the Community  \n\nWe value the health of the
    community and will not engage in behavior that can negatively impact it. This
    includes contaminating food or drink with drugs, or inciting or insisting on the
    consumption of alcohol, psychoactive substances, etc.\n\n### Support Positive
    Interactions Among Participants \n\nWe are committed to engaging constructively
    with others at all times. We will not tolerate bullying, including requesting
    or mobilizing others, either in person or online, to bully others.\n\nWe recognize
    that disagreements, especially about technology, are a necessary part of the software
    development process. However, argument cultures can be counterproductive. When
    disagreeing with someone:\n\n1. Address the idea, not the person. People of all
    experience levels make errors. People of all experience levels can learn more
    about the people our technology helps.\n2. People choose different technology
    stacks and operating systems to meet their unique needs. The use of one type of
    device does not render someone's opinion more or less valid.\n3. We are committed
    to help people learn, and to learn from them. We do not require that all participants
    act as mentors. If an opportunity for mentorship emerges, and you prefer not to
    be a mentor, we will find a match in the community.\n4. If you need help with
    the discussion, please get in touch with the code of conduct team, and we will
    be happy to moderate.\n\n#### Overseeing the COC\n\nThe Meedan team will be overseeing
    the Code of Conduct, including addressing all incident reports. Breaking the code
    of conduct may result in immediate expulsion from the event or forum.\n\n####
    How  to Report an Incident\n\nIf you witness an incident or are the victim of
    one, there are several ways to report it to the Meedan team. \n\n1. During conferences,
    we will provide email addresses and phone numbers to attendees. This information
    will be provided during registration and on site. The response team will be introduced
    during opening remarks and you can ask at the registration point for a member
    of the response team to meet you. \n2. You can email them at codeofconduct@meedan.com\n3.
    You can contact the Meedan team directly immediately on our forums. The username
    of the person responsible for the Code of Conduct will be listed in the copy of
    the Code of Conduct on the forum documentation, README files, and pinned posts.\n\nWe
    use encrypted email and messengers, so if you're more comfortable with another
    messenger app, let your moderators know. All reports are kept confidential. We
    will not reveal your name or other information without your consent. "
