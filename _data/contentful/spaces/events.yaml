  description: On April 28, Kala Sung from Kala's Kimchi teaches us about the health
    benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting
    kimchi at home.
  long_description: |+
    In this SPACE10 Session, Kala Sung from Kala’s Kimchi teaches us about the health benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting kimchi at home.

    ### This Week
    Korean kimchi is a lacto-fermented food, usually made from napa cabbage, Korean radish or other vegetables. There is growing evidence that fermented foods such as kimchi may improve intestinal health and as a result support the immune system and anti-inflammatory responses (Kok & Hutkins, 2018). Chef Kala Sung will show us how to make kimchi at home, while delving further into science behind the health benefits of fermented foods and kimchi in particular.

    ### About the Guest
    Kala ‘Kimchi Kueen’ Sung is a Korean New Yorker, an experienced and renowned chef and MA of Food Studies from NYU. Kala travels the world with her creative and culinary workshop, Kala’s Kimchi. She adapts traditional fermenting techniques to local produce and is continually introducing modern twists while retaining kimchi’s distinctive qualities.

    ### How to Attend
    This SPACE10 Session is hosted on Zoom. You can sign up by clicking the ‘Attend’ button below and submitting your name, email address, and location. From then on, just download Zoom so you’re ready to go — it should all take two minutes in total.

    On the day, be ready and logged in by 5pm so we can welcome all participants at once. But if you’re late, don’t worry — you can sneak in, we won’t tell anyone. When you enter the event, you will be muted to make the sonic experience as smooth as possible for all of us — but we hope you’ll drop an emoji or a greeting in the chat.

  description: Join veteran journalist and Rappler co-founder Maria Ressa in conversation
    with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist, to discuss reporting
    barriers during COVID-19. June 18 on Zoom.
  long_description: "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, free flow of reliable and independent
    information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However,
    with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people have
    limited access to independent information, and few spaces  to dialogue and discuss
    the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain the pandemic.\n\nThis
    challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly complex and evolving
    information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers are expected to
    distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious disease.\n\nPeople
    need news and information they can trust. Instead of making this available, governments
    are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information and scrutinising voices
    that seek accountability. \n\nIn order to analyse and discuss potential solutions
    to the current misinfodemic, Meedan is hosting an online event titled, ‘Reporting
    Barriers During COVID-19. The session will have veteran journalist and co-founder
    of Rappler, Maria Ressa in conversation with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning
    medical journalist. Maria has been leading the fight for freedom of press in the
    Philippines. For her courage and work on disinformation, Maria was named Time
    Magazine’s 2018 Person of the Year, was among its 100 Most Influential People
    of 2019, and has also been named one of Time's Most Influential Women of the Century.
    Seema was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team
    from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected
    diseases.\n\nLive on Zoom\n[Register now to sign up for the Zoom event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n##
    About the Series: Women, Media and the Pandemic\nThis event is first in the Check
    Global Network’s webinar series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’. Launched on May
    5, 2020, Check Global members are currently located in the Philippines, Indonesia,
    Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mexico. As a community
    of independent media, technology and human rights groups, the Check Global Network
    plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges, to design collaborative
    projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners in emerging economies.
    \n\nFor more information about joining the network, please write to us at checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com
    with a statement of interest.\n\nThe event will be hosted on Zoom on June 18,
    2020 at 11PM Manila/8:30 PM Delhi/ 5PM CET/ 11AM ET/ 8AM PT. We will share Zoom
    details with you once you have signed up!\n\n[REGISTER NOW](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n##

    of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of al-Qaeda’s Newest Center of Operations in
    Southeast Asia and From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years
    of Terrorism.\n\n__Seema Yasmin__ is an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist,

    in medicine at the University of Cambridge.\n\nYasmin was a finalist for the Pulitzer
    Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning News and received
    an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected diseases. She received two grants
    from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and was selected as a John S. Knight

  long_description: "What do we know about why COVID-19 impacts Black Americans more
    aggressively than others? Can tear gas make COVID-19 worse? Will recent protests
    lead to an outbreak, or second wave of infections? Can we trust antibody tests
    to tell who has been infected and who hasn't?\n\nOn the heels of nation-wide protests
    against police brutality and amid systemic racism in America, health desks are
    now asking how race, systemic bias, police tactics and protests impact COVID-19.
    \n\n__Dr. Seema Yasmin__, an Emmy-award winning journalist and medical doctor
    joins Instagram Live with __Dr. Christin Gilmer__, a Global Health Scientist with
    a background in infectious diseases, international health systems, and population
    health and technology. \n\nTogether, the two experts are set to discuss top highlights
    from the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/), focusing
    specifically on public health conversations around race and racism in America.\n"

  description: Text similarity algorithms can help fact-checkers locate misinformation,
    cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks when operating
    tip lines on end-to-end encrypted platforms.
  long_description: |-
    Misinformation about COVID-19 has led to severe harms in multiple instances: as an example, a rumor that drinking methanol would cure the virus resulted in hundreds of deaths. While end-to-end encryption is an important privacy safeguard, this encryption prevents platforms such as WhatsApp, Signal, and others from employing centralized interventions and warnings about misinformation. Several options, however, from user interface changes to tip lines to having more intelligence on client devices offer hope.

    In this presentation Dr Scott A. Hale will discuss how text similarity algorithms are being used to help fact-checkers locate misinformation, cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks in the context of tip lines on platforms with end-to-end encryption. The presentation will detail research at the Oxford Internet Institute and Meedan, a global technology not-for-profit developing open-source tools for fact-checking and translation, that is actively being used by fact-checkers to improve the information available online.

    The session will be a 30 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of questions. Dr Chico Camargo, Postdoctoral Researcher in Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, will moderate the session.

    **Dr Scott A. Hale** is a Senior Research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford; Director of Research at Meedan; and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His cross-disciplinary research develops and applies new techniques in the computational sciences to social science questions and puts the results into practice with industry and policy partners. He is particularly interested in mobilization/collective action, agenda setting, and antisocial behaviour (e.g., hate speech) and has a strong track record in building tools and teaching programmes that enable wider access to new methods and forms of data.

  description: Natural language processing and semantic change can help policymakers,

    pulse of the online health conversation.
  long_description: "Natural language processing and semantic change can help policymakers,
    public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep a finger on the
    pulse of the online health conversation.\n\nIn 2019, Meedan's Digital Health Lab
    in collaboration with researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute, the Harvard
    T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and University of Michigan's Department of
    Computer Science developed and tested approaches to help policymakers, public
    health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep a finger on the pulse
    of the online health conversation.\n\nBy modifying semantic change detection methods,
    we found we could identify when health words were being used in new, unexpected
    ways. Many of these shifts were due to large external events, but a few were due
    to misinformation. \n\nThe research is [detailed in an 8-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzyr1e9tSJs&list=PLEcKYh_fjP9hsDdFjnRkxFdDKARmivAPg&index=13
    \"Presentation of the research on YouTube\") and will be discussed at Global Fact
    7, the annual conference of the International Fact-Checking Network on Wednesday,
    June 24."

    ## About the Author
    *[Keep Calm and Log On](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/)* is the first book from Dr. Gillian Andrews, known to most as Gus.

    Dr. Andrews’s unusual background as a hacker, scholar, and educator makes her uniquely suited to offer advice on managing the media in your life. A graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University, she put her passion for media literacy to work in creating [The Media Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/themediashow), an award-winning YouTube series for a young adult audience. Currently, she works as a digital security trainer, running trainings and producing curriculum materials for tech companies, the NGO Tactical Tech, and the forthcoming Cyber Nation film project.

    Dr. Andrews hasn’t been surprised in the slightest by news that foreign intelligence agencies, advertisers, and social media sites are exploiting everyday people’s data. As a former panelist on the digital rights radio show “Off The Hook” and an organizer for the Hackers On Planet Earth conference, she has been tracking warnings about digital privacy and security issues for over a decade. In her user experience work for ThoughtWorks, Second Life, Simply Secure, and the Open Internet Tools project, she has helped developers make digital systems easier for everyday people to use safely.

    Dr. Andrews is a dynamic writer and speaker who is keen to help her fellow citizens protect themselves in a year which promises escalated cybersecurity and disinformation attacks.

  description: Our Latin America Progam Manager, Isabella Barroso, will host the Glitter
    Meetup of the IFF community and explore the dangers of relyng on social media
    platforms to archive activist content.
  long_description: "The idea is to mobilize the community around the topic of corporate
    social media platforms becoming the recordkeepers of activist history while there
    is still a total lack of transparency regarding their content moderation policies.
    Join us in trying to come up with new ways to fix this, as an attempt to counter,
    together, the bleak yet possible scenario of an erasing of activist histories.\n\nA
    few question we will explore:\n  -  How can open source technology contribute
    to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard activist content and history?\n  -
    \ What are pathways to reach out to communities?\n  -  What are the data sources
    for feminists archives in social media?\n  -  What are the challenges of collecting
    this information and content in Latin America/the world?\n  - How to share this
    knowledge with activists? \n\nInvitation via: <a href=\"mailto:team@internetfreedomfestival.org\">team@internetfreedomfestival.org</a>.\n"

  description: This RightsCon session is around the topic of social media platforms
    becoming recordkeepers of activists’ history while there is still a lack of transparency
    on their content moderation policies.
  long_description: |-
    Content on Instagram remains at-risk of deletion, hacking, or censorship, even while feminist and activist groups in Latin America still predominantly organize on the social platform. Recent changes in the social context with the rise of conservative governments in Bolivia, Brazil, Nicaragua, Chile, Peru, and the North Triangle might impact how these platforms succumb to political pressure to censor content. This has happened before when YouTube’s new algorithmic policies, rolled out in 2017, has led to documentation of human rights abuses in Syria disappearing overnight. According to a recent EFF report, “Caught in the Net: The Impact of ‘Extremist’ Speech Regulations on Human Rights Content,” in which YouTube has used machine learning-powered automated flagging to terminate thousands of Syrian YouTube channels that were publishing videos documenting human rights violations.

    How can open source technology contribute to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard activist content and history? Join us in sharing insights, trying to come up with new ways, tools, and designs to fix this, as an attempt to counter, together, the bleak yet possible scenario of an erasing of activist histories. This panel will discuss specific examples of censored content and how open source archiving technologies can help create useful records for critical events relevant to human rights violations.

    This session aims to ignite a conversation and mobilize the RightsCon community around the topic of corporate social media platforms becoming the de facto recordkeepers of activists’ history while there is still a lack of transparency regarding Big Tech’s content moderation policies. Strengthening the community network by sharing how open source technology can help safeguard activist content history.

    Speakers include:

    - __Dr. Dima Saber__,  Research in Media and Cultural Studies Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural, Birmingham City University
    - __Natalie Cadranel__, Founder and Director, Open Archive
    - __Friedhelm Weinberg__, Executive Director of HURIDOCS
    - __Iván Martínez__, Advocacy Officer,  R3D: Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales

    Organizer and moderator: __Isabella Barroso__, Program Manager at Meedan

  description: While fake news threatens our democracy, fake health news threatens
    our lives.
  long_description: "While fake news threatens our democracy, fake health news threatens
    our lives. From vaccines and infectious viruses to cancer drugs and diets, there
    are thousands of pieces of health misinformation on the internet. While some may
    only result in a little confusion, others have serious and troubling effects.
    \ Increasingly, medical misinformation is seen as a human rights issue because
    the spread of misinformation about health and disease prevention, such as false
    information on risks associated with vaccines, or cancer cure, may deter people
    from taking timely healthcare decisions that protect their health, putting them
    at great risk.   \n\nToday, medical misinformation aided and abetted by social
    media is a growing problem that is harming public health and putting millions
    of people at risk of having their basic rights to health violated and limited.
    Misinformation misleads, reinforces discrimination, facilitates stigma associated
    with mental health and undermines human dignity. Join us for a masterclass workshop
    on how to identify and debunk medical misinformation, false claims, hoaxes and
    outright lies. The session will share experience from fact-checking initiatives
    and global health misinformation researchers from Full Fact, DataLEADS, the University
    of Lagos, and PesaCheck.   \n\nWe’ll integrate insights from health fact-checking
    research conducted by Meedan’s Digital Health Lab, a public health research unit
    working at the intersection of access to health and access to information. We’ll
    review findings that prioritize audience safety and privacy and the importance
    of applying public health standards of care to health communications. The masterclass
    will also share examples of how freedom of information laws can enhance evidence-based
    health reporting and fact-checking. \n\n\n__Nat Gyenes__\nDirector, Digital Health

    the voices of young global health leaders, including members of The Global Fund
    Youth Council, IntraHealth’s Family Planning Youth Ambassador team, young advocacy
    and policy leaders, and extraordinary artists such as CJ Suitt, Culture Mill,
    and Kenyan acclaimed musical artist Juliani. The Global Fund CEO Peter Sands,
    IntraHealth International CEO Polly Dunford, and global specialists will join
    us as we focus on critical global health needs even as countries respond to the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Registration is free and open, though attendance will be capped

    Memes to Movements author An Xiao Mina about her new book, published by Tiller
    Press.
  long_description: |-
    Don’t read the comments. Old advice, yet more relevant than ever. The tools we once hailed for their power to connect people and spark creativity can also be hotbeds of hate, harassment, and political division. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are under fire for either too much or too little moderation. Creating and maintaining healthy online communities isn’t easy.

    Over the course of two years of graduate research at MIT, former tech journalist and current product manager Anika Gupta interviewed moderators who’d worked on the sidelines of gamer forums and in the quagmires of online news comments sections. She’s spoken with professional and volunteer moderators for communities like Pantsuit Nation, Nextdoor, World of Warcraft guilds, Reddit, and FetLife.

    [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) is the perfect book for anyone looking to take their small community group to the next level, start a career in online moderation, or tackle their own business’s comments section.

    Join [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) author Anika Gupta in conversation with [Memes to Movements](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567159/memes-to-movements-by-an-xiao-mina/) author An Xiao Mina about her new book, published by Tiller Press.

    ### About the Author
    Anika Gupta is a digital thought leader whose research on online communities spans several industries. A former science and technology journalist, she's currently a senior product manager at The Atlantic. In 2019, she was honored as a member of the Online News Association's Women's Leadership Accelerator, a program that finds and trains women media leaders for roles as leaders in the industry. She has a Master's degree in comparative media studies from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor's degree in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.

  description: 'A Check Global Network Event: Join us as we bring together 3 independent
    media organisations ensuring accessibility and diversity in their newsrooms while
    working in challenging regional contexts.'
  long_description: "Only when the cost of access to information is minimal in a country
    can it give way to diverse and vibrant voices of the citizenry. Yet, in many parts
    of the world, structural inequalities, opaque rules, lack of infrastructure and
    resistance from authorities stand in the way. To understand this systemic failure,
    it is important to break it down to a few key questions: Who seeks information?
    Who is denied information? Which information is hidden or does not exist? How
    costly and easy is the access?\n\nAs we observe the [International Day for Universal
    Access to Information](https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/accesstoinformationday)
    on September 28, it is important to acknowledge and learn from those who address
    these questions on a daily basis. To mark this day, Meedan is hosting an online
    event that brings together three innovative and independent newsrooms that are
    led by women, are editorially independent and are uncovering stories of public
    interest and importance in the emerging economies of Brazil, Egypt and India.\n\nThe
    ability to scrutinise, hold power to account and provide a platform for debate
    are roles that a free press and independent media can perform. Yet, governments
    in several countries are stifling criticism by attacking independent media organisations.
    These entities and media persons associated with them are at constant risk of
    being persecuted for their reporting, harassed for holding power to account and
    being starved of financial support. \n\nIn this context, we take a look at how
    [Al-Manassa](https://almanassa.com/en) (Egypt), [Fiquem Sabendo](https://fiquemsabendo.com.br/)
    (Brazil) and [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (India), three independent
    media organisations are able to:\n- ensure independence, plurality and diversity
    in their newsrooms while working in regions and contexts that are challenging\n-
    build trust with audiences and innovate constantly\n- provide access to information
    for hard to reach communities\n- bring a feminist voice and perspective to media
    content \n\nJoin us in a conversation with the women who lead these organisations
    — Nora Younis, Maria Vitoria Ramos and Disha Mullick — on September 28, 2020.
    \n\n### About the Speakers \n__Disha Mullick__ is the CEO of [Chambal Media](https://chambalmedia.com/),
    a company that produces media for rural audiences, with a unique rural feminist
    voice. Chambal Media runs the iconic news brand, Khabar Lahariya, where women
    from remote villages of north India are trained to be professional journalists
    and produce local news in their languages, from their unique perspective. \n\n__Maria
    Vitória Ramos__ is the co-founder and CEO of Fiquem Sabendo, a media startup in
    Brazil keeping the powerful accountable. She was a reporter for Ponte Jornalismo,
    exposing violations of Human Rights by the police and armed forces in Brazil and
    is the author of \"Indigentes: the State that buries without warning\", an investigative
    book that exposes the heartbreaking system that keeps families looking for supposedly
    missing people for years when they have been buried by the Brazilian government.\n\n__Nora
    Younis__ is the founder and chief editor of Al-Manassa, a news outlet in Egypt.
    A rights advocate and journalist, Younis has also worked as managing editor at
    Al-Masry Al-Youm, a popular news daily in Egypt. Recently Younis was at the receiving
    end of the government clamping down on news organizations and was detained in
    the name of running a news website without an operating license. \n\nThis event
    is part of the Check Global Network’s series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’.
    Launched on May 5, 2020, Check Global Network members are currently located in
    the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe
    and Mexico. As a community of independent media, technology and human rights groups,
    the Check Global Network plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges,
    to design collaborative projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners
    in emerging economies.\n\nFor more information about joining the network, please

Since January, PolitiFact has fact-checked about 600 claims about the coronavirus, most of them false or misleading, while also covering the presidential election and protests against police brutality. From live convention coverage to swatting down viral hoaxes about wildfires, this session will discuss how fact-checkers can juggle multiple major news stories at once and promote the truth on the internet.

    Daniel Funke is a staff writer covering online misinformation for PolitiFact. He previously reported for Poynter as a fact-checking reporter and a Google News Lab Fellow, and has worked for the Los Angeles Times, USA Today and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

  long_description: "Journalists covering elections today face multiple converging
    reporting challenges. In the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic and the president’s own
    diagnosis are shaping the current political news cycle, against a backdrop of
    a year defined by police brutality, thousands of preventable deaths, the future
    of the Supreme Court, historic wildfires and vaccines in development. Covering
    just one of these topics would be a challenge in itself—but newsrooms are faced
    with juggling all of them.\n\nThis isn’t the first time a nation of reporters
    has had to balance many major, rapidly evolving stories. Journalists and fact-checkers
    from India, Taiwan, Zimbabwe and the Philippines have all recently covered elections
    amid massive social and political change. This event is an effort to learn from
    them.\n\nHow can U.S. journalists cover such a challenging presidential race and
    combat viral election misinformation in a way that innovates, but does not strain
    newsroom coverage timelines and staffing resources?\n\nJoin our panelists and
    our moderator:\n\n__Monika Bauerlein__ is Mother Jones’ chief executive officer
    and previously served as co-editor (with Clara Jeffery) for nine years. Under
    her tenure, Mother Jones has grown its audience twentyfold, doubled the size of
    its staff, established bureaus in Washington and New York, won multiple awards,
    and launched a campaign to establish a new media business model centered on reader
    support for investigative and in-depth reporting.\n\n__Ellen T.Tordesillas__ is
    trustee and writer of [VERA Files](https://verafiles.org/), a group that undertakes
    in-depth reporting on current issues. VERA Files is a signatory of the International
    Fact Checking Network and a third-party fact checker of Facebook in the Philippines.
    As reporter, Ellen covered major beats  including the Presidency. She has covered
    all Philippine elections since 1986.\n\n__Jency Jacob__ is the managing editor
    of [BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in), India's premier fact checking digital initiative
    based out of Mumbai. Jency manages a newsroom of enterprising fact checkers who
    are striving to keep our social media and public space clear of misinformation
    and communally sensitive disinformation that can result in real-life implications.
    The fact checking initiative that began as a small team of 3 reporters has now
    grown to 25 people, covering English and 3 Indian languages and also neighbouring
    countries like Bangladesh. Jency is also a regular speaker at various national
    and international conferences, speaking about the importance of battling misinformation
    and the media's role in countering them with credible and factual news stories.

    __Biased and inaccurate information on social media__

    There has been a great deal of concern about the negative impacts of social media on democracy and society. In this talk, I provide an overview of my research on two ways in which social networks can negatively affect public discourse. First, I will discuss studies examining the spread of misinformation on Twitter. I begin by describing a hybrid lab-field study in which Twitter users complete a cognitive survey. I show that people who rely on intuitive gut responses over analytical thinking share lower quality content. I then build on this observation with a Twitter field experiment that uses a subtle intervention to nudge people to think about accuracy. I show the intervention significantly improve the quality of the news sources they shared subsequently. Our experimental design translates directly into an intervention that social media companies could deploy to fight misinformation online. Next, I will briefly discuss a set of large social network experiments in which human subjects play a voter game on an artificial social network I constructed. These experiments demonstrate how, even in the absence of misinformation, decisions can be heavily biased by the structure of the network via a phenomenon we call “information gerrymandering”. Finally, I will describe my ongoing work on effective fact-check delivery on social media.

    Dr Mohsen Mosleh is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at University of Exeter Business School and a Research Affiliate at MIT. Mohsen has been a postdoctoral fellow in the Human Cooperation Lab at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Department of Psychology at Yale University. Prior to his post-doctoral studies, Mohsen received his PhD from Stevens Institute of Technology in Systems Engineering with a minor in data science. He has five years of prior industry experience as a Software & Systems Integration Lead. Mohsen’s research interests lie at the intersection of computational/data science and cognitive/social science. In particular, he studies how information and misinformation spread on social media, collective decision-making, and cooperation.

    for grantees to share their projects and challenges faced during the pandemic
    and its effects on their wellbeing. The idea is to strengthen the community by
    listening and sharing healing practices that are ancestral and decolonial.\\\n\nIf

    Somalia, Tanzania and Zambia received grants to support their work to highlight
    and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent. \n\nThese initiatives included
    [a student-founded project in Nigeria](http://www.peoplescheck.org/) to fact-check
    and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that has affected people's
    health and lives, a [Somali language radio station](https://www.daljir.com/) that
    ran media literacy campaigns and radio reporting in Puntland and Galmudug regions
    to bring health facts to the public and [a Guinean network of volunteers](http://www.zeropauvreafrique.org)
    that tracked and deconstructed false information around the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nOther
    awards included a [Tanzanian campaign](https://www.instagram.com/constructiveactivism/)
    to document and share information around injustices, human rights abuse and repressions
    associated to COVID-19 interventions in the country in collaboration with human
    rights defenders, activists and local artists, a Kenyan social media campaign
    to highlight violence against women related to the pandemic, and a [youth-led

  description: This is the closing event for seven local and regional organizations
    in the Asia-Pacific region which received grants to cover the impact of the COVID-19
    pandemic in their communities.
  long_description: "Seven grass-root media organizations from Cambodia, the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka were awarded Check Global's COVID-19 microgrants
    in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\nDuring the pandemic, vulnerable groups faced the
    risk of being cut off from vital information, especially crucial health information.
    The projects we supported in the region aimed at addressing this issue, and focusing
    on removing barriers to accessing media and technology.\n\nThese projects ranged
    from a [website to provide fact-checked content for the differently abled](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/),[
    powerful imagery in social media](https://www.facebook.com/storiesofwomencampaign/)
    to highlight violence against women, [a digitial literacy campaign](https://basabali.org/)
    and [blogs capturing the stories of frontline workers](https://iyapsl.org/).\n\nOn
    November 20, 2020, we are hosting an event bringing together the COVID-19 microgrant
    recipients and other [Check Global partners](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
    from the region to share their experiences and challenges of working amid a devastating
    pandemic and yet make a lasting impact in communities they work for. All participants
    will get the opportunity to speak about their work using different formats and
    this will be followed by an informal meet and greet session. Since this is a diverse
    group with varying projects, languages and time zones, the presentation formats
    are flexible. The aim is to have more voices, including team members and people
    from the community level, and enable collaborations across the region.\n\nIf you

  long_description: "Four independent media workers and organizations operating in
    the NAWA region received funding to produce and sustain creative, necessary local
    journalistic work. \n\nThese initiatives have worked in  particularly challenging
    conditions, and the work they did ranged from the production of a digital health
    program through [a popular community radio station](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3175873192467573),
    to a [trilingual health fact-checking campaign](https://nawaat.org/) in Tunisia,
    an essential and important investigation on [the plight of African refugees in
    Tangier](https://www.lejournaldetanger.com/reportage-a-tanger-le-calvaire-pour-la-survie-des-migrants-subsahariens/)
    amidst the pandemic, and a painstaking three-part investigation documenting the
    [Syrian regime's inadequate health response to the pandemic](https://syriauntold.com/2020/08/04/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B6%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%A7/).\n\nOur
    grantees' experiences, therefore, provide a much needed teaching opportunity for
    aspiring and budding journalists in NAWA. We've opted, in that sense, to convene
    a closed panel on November 14th that would bring together the COVID-19 microgrant
    NAWA grantees with our 25 journalism students participating in the [Check NAWA
    Newsroom](https://nawamedia.org/newsroom/). Our students, who have been receiving
    [training and mentorship](https://nawamedia.org/blog/2020/05/08/open-democracy-training-for-nawa-newsroom-students/)
    on investigative journalism and open-source skills, have also done the grueling
    job of creating active remote newsrooms in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. \n\nDespite
    their dedication, our students have been forced to reckon with the challenges
    brought by remote journalistic work such as lacking internet access, debilitating
    local events, and a pandemic. Through our event, students will get the opportunity
    to ask questions to the COVID-19 microgrant NAWA grantees while also learning
    about their diverse projects. \n\nIf you would like to know more about our NAWA

  long_description: |-
    The Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and Meedan welcome OII Visiting Policy Fellow and Meedan Board Member Tim Hwang, discussing his new book ‘Subprime Attention Crisis’ with Dr Scott A. Hale, a Senior Research Fellow at the OII and Director of Resarch at Meedan. Tim is a writer and researcher focusing on public policy and emerging technologies. This session will be a deep-dive conversation exploring how the modern online advertising economy really works, how fragile it may be in reality, and how we might move the internet towards a more sustainable future.

    Programmatic advertising—high-speed, algorithmically-facilitated, data-driven advertising—is the cornerstone of the modern internet. It has produced untold wealth for major companies like Facebook and Google, and is the predominant way that online media is made financially sustainable. At its heart, it is based in the idea that the vast trove of data available about people online enables hyper-targeted, hyper-effective persuasion. This promise has driven huge financial gains for businesses, and inspired countless op-eds from technology critics and commentators concerned about the influence of message microtargeting on individuals and society at large. But, much of what we know about online advertising suggests that these visions of an omnipotent persuasion engine are far from reality. In 2014, Google estimated that nearly 60% of ads on the internet are never seen. In 2017, Proctor and Gamble—one of the world’s largest advertisers—cut nearly $200M from its online advertising budget, to little effect.

    The ostensible strength of online advertising is in reality, likely to be a bubble. The market has been sustainable in part through the economic destruction of traditional media, the perverse incentives of buyers and sellers of advertising, and the surprising opacity of the digital marketplace for attention. Even as attention online is increasingly “subprime”, these dynamics push the market towards new heights.

    political, and mental health challenges experienced by independent media workers
    in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast. '
  long_description: |-
    On August 4, 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut's port ripped through half of the capital, taking 200 lives, injuring thousands and rendering 300,000 homeless. The impact of the blast was also felt by independent media workers, who'd had -- over the years -- taken up headquarters in the neighborhoods that had been hit the most. In the midst of an economic collapse and a crippling pandemic, independent media workers have had to also adapt in the midst of a state of emergency, acknowledge the limitations of the current donor-based business model as well as deal with the trauma incurred by the blast.

    This MENA Community Knowledge session (MENA CKS) will focus on:

    -   The impact of the martial law on the security and freedom of independent journos after the blast
    -   How the blast affected the business model of independent media outlets and the role of  emergency funding for media

  long_description: |-
    While definitions and experiences of feminism vary across different parts of the world, structural gender inequalities and resistance from local authorities to legislate in ways which favour the enhancement of women rights are arguably common challenges anywhere we look. But while there seems to be a consensus on the urgent need to address these inequalities, experiences of feminism(s) across countries of the Global South continue to be looked at through a Western lens, which results in tensions with Western and Euro-centric conceptions of feminism and undermines efforts for real impact and social change.

    Working within the framework of BCMCR’s research theme ‘Alternativity’ and drawing on perspectives from India and the South-Asia region, this panel brings together three women who have been at the forefront of the battle for gender equality and women rights across non-Western academic, media and activist circles. Srila Roy will share with us her reading of what feminist and queer politics look like in a globalised India today, Disha Mullick will explore the journey of an independent rural women-only publication from print to online, and Shalini Joshi will present her research on the impact of COVID19 on women in the APAC region, in the light of State crackdowns against women activists, journalists, and freedom fighters.

    The panel will be followed by a Q&A session moderated by Yemisi Akinbobola.

    Panelists:

    Prof Srila Roy is Associate Professor of Sociology, and heads Development Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. She is the author of Remembering Revolution: Gender, Violence and Subjectivity in India’s Naxalbari Movement (Oxford, 2012), editor of New South Asian Feminisms (Zed, 2012) and co-editor of New Subaltern Politics (Oxford 2015). She is currently writing a monograph on feminist and queer politics in globalised India and co-editing a volume of essays on MeToo in India and South Africa. At Wits, she leads the Andrew W. Mellon funded Governing Intimacies project, which promotes new scholarship on gender and sexuality in Southern Africa and India.

    Disha Mullick is the CEO of Chambal Media, a company that produces media for rural audiences. Chambal Media runs Khabar Lahariya, India’s only all-women rural news channel, which recently went digital and video-first. Disha trains and mentors disadvantaged women from remote villages of North India to be professional journalists and produce local news in their languages, from their unique perspective. She has an MA in Gender studies from the University of Warwick and is an Acumen Fellow. She has also worked in publishing and as a journalist before her journey with Khabar Lahariya.

    Shalini Joshi is the Program Director for the Asia-Pacific region at Meedan where she provides support to fact-checkers, newsrooms, activists and academics involved in addressing and researching misinformation. She started her professional journey with the Nirantar Centre for Gender Education where she trained and mentored rural women from underrepresented communities to come into new and professional roles, often breaking gender stereotypes. She is also the co-founder of Khabar Lahariya, and has been a TruthBuzz Fellow with the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) where she led Checkpoint – a research project focused on misinformation in the Indian elections in 2019.

    Chair:

    Dr Yemisi Akinbobola is Senior Lecturer and International Research Partnerships lead for the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media. Her research is focused on gender, media and African feminism. She is also cofounder of the nongovernmental organisation, African Women in Media. She was recipient of the CNN African Journalism Award (Sports Reporting) in 2016.

  description: PRISM fosters a collaborative learning community for researchers in
    social media and health.
  long_description: |-
    This year's Promoting Research in Social Media and Health Symposium (PRISM) will be a two-day virtual research symposium. PRISM fosters a collaborative learning community for researchers in social media and health. The burgeoning field of social media and health research is broad but distinct from health information technology and mobile health. The PRISM planning committee does far-ranging research on health and social media. Prior work presented at PRISM includes vaccination attitudes, infectious disease outbreaks, tobacco cessation, and tanning bed use, all using online communication.

    PRISM provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity for participants to meet, collaborate, and advance their work. Now in its fifth year, PRISM has hosted academic researchers, industry partners, patients, and advocates from over 40 unique institutions. PRISM is one of the few symposiums dedicated to social media and health research.

    People in the UK began receiving a newly-authorized COVID-19 vaccine on Monday December 7, making the UK the first Western country to issue emergency approval of a vaccine and to launch a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Was approval of the vaccine a political decision? Were scientists rushed by lawmakers? Who will receive the vaccine first and who is next in line? Join Dr. Seema Yasmin and Dr. Amile Inusa for an IG Live on Tuesday December (1 pm PT/ 8 pm GMT) to discuss these questions and more.

    __Dr. Amile Inusa__ completed her training in the competitive North Central Thames Deanery and also worked as a locum doctor for two years primarily in Paediatrics & Emergency Medicine. She studied Medicine at The University of Manchester and holds a Masters (MSc) degree in Healthcare Ethics and Law. With a wide range of medical interests from Paediatrics and Global Health to Medical Education and Genetics, she has sought research opportunities in these areas. In 2017, she founded a podcast called 'Life After The Letters'. She has since transitioned her podcast into a media company in 2020 called 'circa1948' - aimed at serving the healthcare industry. Through this, she is able to pursue her interests and unique understanding of healthcare communication and partner management.

    __Dr. Seema Yasmin__ is an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist, poet, physican and author. Yasmin served as an officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where she investigated disease outbreaks. She trained in journalism at the University of Toronto and in medicine at the University of Cambridge. Yasmin was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected diseases. She received two grants from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and was selected as a John S. Knight Fellow in Journalism at Stanford University iin 2017 where she investigated the spread of health misinformation and disinformation during epidemics.

    __"Short is the Road that Leads from Fear to Hate": Fear Speech in Indian WhatsApp Groups__

    WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world. Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such `fear speech' messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.

    Dr Animesh Mukherjee an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Prior to this, he was working as a post doctoral researcher in the Complex Systems Lagrange Lab, ISI Foundation, Italy. He received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a thesis on self-organization of human speech sound inventories. His main research interests center around applying complex system approaches (mainly complex networks and agent-based simulations) to different problems in (a) human language evolution and change, (b) web social media, (c) information retrieval and (d) natural language processing.

    Vaccine fears are as old as vaccines themselves. Vaccine denialism has emerged as one of the biggest global health threats of the 21st century, with misinformation and rumors threatening to undo one of the greatest scientific achievements of the last 200 years.

    What are the philosophical objections rooted in these hesitancies? Why do people question the motives of scientists and doctors? If vaccine rumors are here to stay, how do we move forward in the name of a healthier world?

    Join Meedan Digital Health Lab Director Nat Gyenes and Heidi Larson, founder of the [Vaccine Confidence Project](https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/), anthropologist and author of [*Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start—and Why They Don’t Go Away*](https://bookshop.org/books/stuck-how-vaccine-rumors-start-and-why-they-don-t-go-away/9780190077242 "Stuck book") for a conversation about the roots of vaccine misbeliefs and how we can change them.

  long_description: "Nat Gyenes, Director of Meedan's Digital Health Lab and Kat Lo,
    Content Moderation Lead, lead this session to identify and explore public health
    content moderation challenges online. \n\nThe world now has more internet users
    than people with access to essential health services such as primary care, dental
    care, or surgery. Exacerbated through the COVID-19 pandemic, populations around
    the world experience limited availability of in-person health providers or services
    for certain health conditions, and as a result, the internet plays a crucial role
    in mediating access to health through access to information. However, the consequences
    of online health information have never been more pertinent.\n\n[In this session](https://nnlm.gov/class/addressing-health-misinformation-scale-internet/31120),
    we will focus on the unique role that health practitioners, experts and library
    systems can play in responding to related challenges. We will review existing
    interventions that social media platforms are deploying to try to address health
    misinformation at global, internet scales, the strengths and limitations of these
    approaches, and how physicians of the future can contribute to a healthier online
    information ecosystem.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\n- To understand the unique
    role that public health expertise and public health resources play in responding
    to online misinformation\n- To examine existing infrastructures that platforms
    (Facebook, Google, WhatsApp) have developed for responding to misinformation\n-
    To identify content moderation interventions that have been previously and currently
    employed by social media platforms to respond to different types of misinformation\n-
    To examine the constraints and trade-offs of different moderation strategies"

  long_description: |-
    Director of Research, Dr Scott A. Hale, examines how machine learning can help fact-checkers decide what to fact-check, perform fact-checks more efficiently, and disseminate fact-checks effectively.

    Creating high-quality fact-checks is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Computational methods, workflow software, and machine learning can free fact-checkers to focus on the important aspects. Bots can handle interaction on tiplines and machine learning can detect and match claims to help fact-checkers decide what content to prioritize. Similarly, algorithms to search existing fact-checks, locate relevant articles in knowledge bases, and evaluate existing content (stance detection) can help in the process of performing a fact-check.

    Dr Hale will also discuss bigger picture aspects such as the differences between political fact-checking and health fact-checking, user-interface design choices, social factors, and academic–practitioner collaboration.

    This talk is hosted by the [Institute for the Next Generation of Journalism and Media at Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/cro/other/2020/03/29/4193/ "Institute for the Next Generation of Journalism and Media at Waseda University") and [FactCheck Initiative Japan](https://en.fij.info/ "FactCheck Initiative Japan").
    *The talk will be in English with simultaneous translation to Japanese. Although the registration form is in Japanese, you will be able to choose the language you wish to listen in.*

    Dr Scott A. Hale is Director of Research at Meedan, a non-profit building digital tools for global journalism and translation. He sets strategy and oversees research on widening access to quality information online and seeks to foster greater academic–industry collaboration through chairing multistakeholder groups, developing and releasing real-world datasets, and connecting academic and industry organizations. Scott is also a member of the Credibility Coalition, an Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute.

    In this thought-provoking event, author Joanne McNeil is joined by technologist/ artist & Meedan Senior Front-End Developer Darius Kazemi as they examine how in the 1990's and early aughts, people became users, and users put their trust in a corporation to do the job of a library.

    What happens to library values such as privacy, preservation and enduring access to knowledge in the era of surveillance capitalism? Is Google the “internet’s library,” and if not, where should we turn for collections of knowledge at scale?

    Presented by Library Futures & the Internet Archive, this discussion invites you to explore whether we’ve traded convenience for the protections that libraries have always offered: privacy, preservation, and equitable access to knowledge. And if so, where do we go from here?

  long_description: "World Press Freedom Day, observed on May 3, is a reminder to
    governments of the need to respect their commitments to press freedom. It’s also
    a day to extend support to journalists and newsrooms who are being attacked, restrained,
    arrested and silenced for speaking truth to power. \n\nGovernments around the
    world have used the COVID-19 pandemic to [restrict journalists](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/04/governments-are-using-covid-19-as-an-excuse-to-crack-down-on-press-freedom/?utm_source=Daily%20Lab%20email%20list&utm_campaign=7f67c1e6e6-dailylabemail3&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d68264fd5e-7f67c1e6e6-396133365&fbclid=IwAR0QbM2DaCWTrweN8obVB7coacqPv22esMzyZl_qkvHy6qk0BXYLMJfRFpM
    \"Governments are using Covid-19 as an excuse to crack down on press freedom\").
    New laws have been passed in several countries to address the spread of misinformation
    during the pandemic; however, these laws are often a [disguised attack on independent
    journalism](https://ipi.media/over-600-covid-19-related-press-freedom-violations-in-past-year/?mc_cid=448824486f&mc_eid=89968079c7
    \"Over 600 COVID-19 related press freedom violations in past year\"). Journalists
    have been targeted online and offline for their work, they have faced vigilante
    attacks and they have also been booked under false criminal charges. In many countries,
    critical voices in the media are being repressed and those that favour governments
    are being strengthened.\n\nAt Meedan, we observe World Press Freedom Day to discuss
    emerging challenges to journalists and press freedom, especially in regions where
    free press is under attack. We also take the opportunity to discuss potential
    solutions and strategies to defend and strengthen press freedom. As a group that
    is committed to improving the quality and equity of online information, Meedan
    is vigilant to attacks on journalists and newsrooms and through our work with
    our partners. We seek to support and strengthen people’s access to free, credible
    and independent news and information. \n\nJoin us and our panelists: Devi Asmarani
    from [Magdalene](https://magdalene.co/category/english \"Magdalene\"), Indonesia,
    Lara Bitar from [The Public Source](https://thepublicsource.org/ar \"The Public
    Source\"), Lebanon, Tania Montalvo from [Animal Politico](https://www.animalpolitico.com/
    \"Animal Politico\"), Mexico and Asha Mwilu from [Debunk Media](https://debunk.media/
    \"Debunk Media\"), Kenya to discuss strategies to defend press freedom and to
    recognise and honour the work of journalists who have struggled to uncover truth
    in challenging times. \n\n## Panelists\n\n**Devi Asmarani**<br>\n[Magdalene](https://magdalene.co/

    As part of the End-to-end encrypted Platforms and Political Misinformation workshop at Stanford Internet Observatory, Dr Scott Hale will be presenting a case study of the 2019 Checkpoint tipline project to combat misinformation during that year's Indian elections.

    This presentation will reflect on Meedan's experience facilitating misinformation tiplines on WhatsApp for fact-checking organizations. Tiplines allow users to submit ‘tips’ containing messages they want
    fact-checked. We compare the tips sent to a WhatsApp tipline run during the 2019 Indian national elections with the messages circulating in large, public groups on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

    We find that tiplines are a very useful lens into WhatsApp conversations: a significant fraction of messages and images sent to the tipline match with content being shared on 'public' WhatsApp groups and other social media. Our analysis also shows that tiplines cover the most popular content well, and a majority of such content is often shared to the tipline before appearing in large, public WhatsApp groups. Overall, the analysis suggests tiplines can be an effective source for discovering content to fact-check, seeding hash-lists of known misinformation, and studying the dynamics of information spread on WhatsApp.

    Snapchat, Tiktok and other short video platforms have put the spotlight on user generated and multi-modal content in driving online narratives. However, machine learning models, be it for claim detection or content moderation, have disproportionately focused on textual content in English.

    Datasets are also skewed towards sources where provenance is explicit such as ‘news’ websites, presidential speeches and television news. For majority of user-generated meme like content, provenance is unclear. In this talk, we will present our work from annotating claims in multi-modal, user generated content from an Indian social media platform and its implications for fact checking and automated approaches to misinformation response.

    This talk will draw from the papers [*Check Mate: Prioritizing User Generated Multi-Media Content for Fact-Checking* (ICWSM 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13387 "Check Mate study"), and *A Contextual Examination of Factuality on Social Media* (4S 2021).

    Hosted by Dr Scott Hale, Director of Research at Meedan & Oxford University faculty.

  title: 'Memeable journalism: how to report with cats and goats'
  description: 'Memes have been a subject of journalists for years now, but can memes
    be an important part of the journalist’s toolkit both for newsgathering and for
    reportage. In this panel, we want to try to find if journalism can find a place
    in the meme arena. What criteria should be followed, if any? The very definition
    of what makes a meme — the remixing, appropriation and their cultural attributes
    make it a hard piece of work for processes that often require strict protocols
    and traditions around objectivity that seem incompatible with meme culture. But
    the definition of what is journalism has shifted a lot in the recent years. One
    of the main aspects of this is the way journalism is thinking, through academic
    work and professional thought leadership, on how to position itself towards how
    to be a part of a conversation in a more effective way through meme usage. In
    Latin America there are not exactly answers to that question, but there’s a newsroom
    and a cohort trying to find some. As El Surti’s visual journalism program, Latinográficas
    managed to not only empower their meme presence in the virtual arena but also
    to start teaching what they’ve learnt through the process to partners based in
    other LatAm spots such as Connectas  and Mutante (Bogotá, Colombia), among others.

    Sometimes the best path is to *not build* the software you need, and to instead leverage existing useful and affordable software tools to both produce engaging programs and maintain the development resources you’ll need elsewhere.

    Join this fascinating conversation, led by Meedan Director of Engineering Caio Almeida and Director of Product Pierre Conti, at Online News Association's 2021 virtual conference to learn more about how to develop the software infrastructures and test new ideas with scarce resources using the tools you have on hand.

    This session is for:
    - Product professionals looking for a survey of useful and affordable technologies
    - Newsrooms leaders interested in low-cost, low-lift ideas and solutions
    - Anyone who values testing new ideas and experimenting with available tools

    *Translated from Portuguese*

    Disinformation is not a problem created by social networks, however, as a result of them, the amount of information consumed and produced has increased exponentially and new automation technologies for the viralization of content have been created. Different actors, in Brazil and in the world, are mobilizing in an attempt to curb online misinformation to preserve, especially, democracy. But what are the lessons learned by those who fight misinformation and its automated push on digital platforms?

    Despite the limitations, whether in terms of access to data or resources, researchers, journalists, academics and developers advance in the construction of knowledge, techniques and tools that help identify the propagators of disinformation in the digital environment.

    At Varanda ITS #104, we invited researchers to discuss the difficulties and limitations of combating misinformation on platforms, the tools and methodologies used, and how knowledge is built. In addition, we want to introduce and encourage knowledge production about Pegabot, our automated profiling platform.

    Participating in the event are João Guilherme Bastos dos Santos, coordinator of the INCT.DD Data Laboratory, Caio Almeida, director of Software Engineering at Meedan, Daniel Schwabe, retired researcher and professor at the Information Technology Department at PUC-Rio, and Thayane Guimarães , senior researcher in the area of Democracy and Technology at ITS. Moderation is in charge of Diego Cerqueira, researcher in the area of Democracy and Technology at ITS.

  long_description: "Misinformation is often edited and repeated across multiple platforms,
    websites, languages, and formats (audio, video, image, text). In this talk, Dr
    Scott A. Hale will detail initiatives to crowdsource misleading content through
    \"tiplines\" on messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram as well as state-of-the-art
    natural language processing approaches to group messages making the same claims.
    \n\nWhile much effort focuses on large, high-resource languages and unencrypted
    platforms. [Tiplines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04726 \"Tiplines to Combat Misinformation
    on Encrypted Platforms: A Case Study of the 2019 Indian Election on WhatsApp\")
    offer the opportunity for users of end-to-end encrypted platforms to share potentially
    \ misleading content with fact-checking organizations and check whether that content
    has been fact-checked. This talk will show how knowledge distillation can be used
    to create machine learning models for [claim matching](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.347/
    \"Claim Matching Beyond English to Scale Global Fact-Checking\") that perform
    well on low-resource as well as high-resource languages.\n\nThe research detailed
    in this talk has been integrated into our product Check and is used by over a
    dozen fact-checking organizations across the globe.  We are currently working
    to [create better infrastructure](https://meedan.com/blog/fact-champ-launch/ \"FACT
    CHAMP launch\") to allow academics, practitioners, and community leaders to collaborate
    more easily on misinformation response."
