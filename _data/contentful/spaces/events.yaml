  description: On April 28, Kala Sung from Kala's Kimchi teaches us about the health
    benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting
    kimchi at home.
  long_description: |+
    In this SPACE10 Session, Kala Sung from Kala’s Kimchi teaches us about the health benefits of fermented foods and shares a recipe to make tasty, immune-boosting kimchi at home.

    ### This Week
    Korean kimchi is a lacto-fermented food, usually made from napa cabbage, Korean radish or other vegetables. There is growing evidence that fermented foods such as kimchi may improve intestinal health and as a result support the immune system and anti-inflammatory responses (Kok & Hutkins, 2018). Chef Kala Sung will show us how to make kimchi at home, while delving further into science behind the health benefits of fermented foods and kimchi in particular.

    ### About the Guest
    Kala ‘Kimchi Kueen’ Sung is a Korean New Yorker, an experienced and renowned chef and MA of Food Studies from NYU. Kala travels the world with her creative and culinary workshop, Kala’s Kimchi. She adapts traditional fermenting techniques to local produce and is continually introducing modern twists while retaining kimchi’s distinctive qualities.

    ### How to Attend
    This SPACE10 Session is hosted on Zoom. You can sign up by clicking the ‘Attend’ button below and submitting your name, email address, and location. From then on, just download Zoom so you’re ready to go — it should all take two minutes in total.

  description: Join veteran journalist and Rappler co-founder Maria Ressa in conversation
    with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist, to discuss reporting
    barriers during COVID-19. June 18 on Zoom.
  long_description: "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, free flow of reliable and independent
    information is absolutely critical to public health and accountability. However,
    with several restrictions imposed on media across different regions, people have
    limited access to independent information, and few spaces  to dialogue and discuss
    the adequacy of measures being taken by their governments to contain the pandemic.
    This challenge is taking place amid a backdrop of an incredibly complex and evolving
    information environment, in which journalists and fact-checkers are expected to
    distill complicated research on epidemiology and infectious disease.\n\nPeople
    need news and information they can trust. Instead of making this available, governments
    are censoring news, curbing the free flow of information and scrutinising voices
    that seek accountability. \n\nIn order to analyse and discuss potential solutions
    to the current misinfodemic, Meedan is hosting an online event titled, ‘Reporting
    Barriers During COVID-19. The session will have veteran journalist and co-founder
    of Rappler, Maria Ressa in conversation with Seema Yasmin, an Emmy Award-winning
    medical journalist. Maria has been leading the fight for freedom of press in the
    Philippines. For her courage and work on disinformation, Maria was named Time
    Magazine’s 2018 Person of the Year, was among its 100 Most Influential People
    of 2019, and has also been named one of Time's Most Influential Women of the Century.
    Seema was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team
    from The Dallas Morning News and received an Emmy Award for her reporting on neglected
    diseases.\n\nLive on Zoom\n[Register now to sign up for the Zoom event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n\n##
    About the Series: Women, Media and the Pandemic\nThis event is first in the Check
    Global Network’s webinar series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’. Launched on May
    5, 2020, Check Global members are currently located in the Philippines, Indonesia,
    Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mexico. As a community
    of independent media, technology and human rights groups, the Check Global Network
    plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges, to design collaborative
    projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners in emerging economies.
    \n\nFor more information about joining the network, please write to us at checkglobalnetwork@meedan.com
    with a statement of interest.\n\nThe event will be hosted on Zoom on June 18,
    2020 at 11PM Manila/8:30 PM Delhi/ 5PM CET/ 11AM ET/ 8AM PT. We will share Zoom
    details with you once you have signed up!\n\n[REGISTER NOW](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegpj2B3_FjygvEXoZsAxhFyS4Vh1izBQoC0pqtG1nTquCfjA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n##

    of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of al-Qaeda’s Newest Center of Operations in
    Southeast Asia and From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Abduction, 10 Years
    of Terrorism.\n\n__Seema Yasmin__ is an Emmy Award-winning medical journalist,

    in medicine at the University of Cambridge.\n\nYasmin was a finalist for the Pulitzer
    Prize in breaking news in 2017 with a team from The Dallas Morning News and received

  long_description: "What do we know about why COVID-19 impacts Black Americans more
    aggressively than others? Can tear gas make COVID-19 worse? Will recent protests
    lead to an outbreak, or second wave of infections? Can we trust antibody tests
    to tell who has been infected and who hasn't?\n\nOn the heels of nation-wide protests
    against police brutality and amid systemic racism in America, health desks are
    now asking how race, systemic bias, police tactics and protests impact COVID-19.
    \n\n__Dr. Seema Yasmin__, an Emmy-award winning journalist and medical doctor
    joins Instagram Live with __Dr. Christin Gilmer__, a Global Health Scientist with
    a background in infectious diseases, international health systems, and population
    health and technology. \n\nTogether, the two experts are set to discuss top highlights
    from the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/), focusing
    specifically on public health conversations around race and racism in America.\n"

  description: Text similarity algorithms can help fact-checkers locate misinformation,
    cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks when operating
    tip lines on end-to-end encrypted platforms.
  long_description: |-
    Misinformation about COVID-19 has led to severe harms in multiple instances: as an example, a rumor that drinking methanol would cure the virus resulted in hundreds of deaths. While end-to-end encryption is an important privacy safeguard, this encryption prevents platforms such as WhatsApp, Signal, and others from employing centralized interventions and warnings about misinformation. Several options, however, from user interface changes to tip lines to having more intelligence on client devices offer hope.

    In this presentation Dr Scott A. Hale will discuss how text similarity algorithms are being used to help fact-checkers locate misinformation, cluster similar misinformation, and identify existing fact-checks in the context of tip lines on platforms with end-to-end encryption. The presentation will detail research at the Oxford Internet Institute and Meedan, a global technology not-for-profit developing open-source tools for fact-checking and translation, that is actively being used by fact-checkers to improve the information available online.

    The session will be a 30 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of questions. Dr Chico Camargo, Postdoctoral Researcher in Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, will moderate the session.

    **Dr Scott A. Hale** is a Senior Research at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford; Director of Research at Meedan; and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. His cross-disciplinary research develops and applies new techniques in the computational sciences to social science questions and puts the results into practice with industry and policy partners. He is particularly interested in mobilization/collective action, agenda setting, and antisocial behaviour (e.g., hate speech) and has a strong track record in building tools and teaching programmes that enable wider access to new methods and forms of data.

  description: Natural language processing and semantic change can help policymakers,
    public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep a finger on the
    pulse of the online health conversation.
  long_description: "We are in extraordinary times, but even prior to the pandemic
    thousands of health conversations were happening on social media everyday. In
    2019, Meedan's Digital Health Lab in collaboration with researchers at the Oxford
    Internet Institute, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and University
    of Michigan's Department of Computer Science developed and tested approaches to
    help policymakers, public health authorities, journalists, and fact-checkers keep
    a finger on the pulse of the online health conversation. By modifying semantic
    change detection methods, we found we could identify when health words were being
    used in new, unexpected ways. Many of these shifts were due to large external
    events, but a few were due to misinformation. \n\nThe research is [detailed in
    an 8-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzyr1e9tSJs&list=PLEcKYh_fjP9hsDdFjnRkxFdDKARmivAPg&index=13
    \"Presentation of the research on YouTube\") and will be discussed at Global Fact
    7, the annual conference of the International Fact-Checking Network on Wednesday,
    June 24."

    ## About the Author
    *[Keep Calm and Log On](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/)* is the first book from Dr. Gillian Andrews, known to most as Gus.

    Dr. Andrews’s unusual background as a hacker, scholar, and educator makes her uniquely suited to offer advice on managing the media in your life. A graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University, she put her passion for media literacy to work in creating [The Media Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/themediashow), an award-winning YouTube series for a young adult audience. Currently, she works as a digital security trainer, running trainings and producing curriculum materials for tech companies, the NGO Tactical Tech, and the forthcoming Cyber Nation film project.

    Dr. Andrews hasn’t been surprised in the slightest by news that foreign intelligence agencies, advertisers, and social media sites are exploiting everyday people’s data. As a former panelist on the digital rights radio show “Off The Hook” and an organizer for the Hackers On Planet Earth conference, she has been tracking warnings about digital privacy and security issues for over a decade. In her user experience work for ThoughtWorks, Second Life, Simply Secure, and the Open Internet Tools project, she has helped developers make digital systems easier for everyday people to use safely.

    Dr. Andrews is a dynamic writer and speaker who is keen to help her fellow citizens protect themselves in a year which promises escalated cybersecurity and disinformation attacks.

  description: Our Latin America Progam Manager, Isabella Barroso, will host the Glitter
    Meetup of the IFF community and explore the dangers of relyng on social media
    platforms to archive activist content.
  long_description: "The idea is to mobilize the community around the topic of corporate
    social media platforms becoming the recordkeepers of activist history while there
    is still a total lack of transparency regarding their content moderation policies.
    Join us in trying to come up with new ways to fix this, as an attempt to counter,
    together, the bleak yet possible scenario of an erasing of activist histories.\n\nA
    few question we will explore:\n  -  How can open source technology contribute
    to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard activist content and history?\n  -
    \ What are pathways to reach out to communities?\n  -  What are the data sources
    for feminists archives in social media?\n  -  What are the challenges of collecting
    this information and content in Latin America/the world?\n  - How to share this
    knowledge with activists? \n\nInvitation via: <a href=\"mailto:team@internetfreedomfestival.org\">team@internetfreedomfestival.org</a>.\n"

  description: This RightsCon session is around the topic of social media platforms
    becoming recordkeepers of activists’ history while there is still a lack of transparency
    on their content moderation policies.
  long_description: |-
    Content on Instagram remains at-risk of deletion, hacking, or censorship, even while feminist and activist groups in Latin America still predominantly organize on the social platform. Recent changes in the social context with the rise of conservative governments in Bolivia, Brazil, Nicaragua, Chile, Peru, and the North Triangle might impact how these platforms succumb to political pressure to censor content. This has happened before when YouTube’s new algorithmic policies, rolled out in 2017, has led to documentation of human rights abuses in Syria disappearing overnight. According to a recent EFF report, “Caught in the Net: The Impact of ‘Extremist’ Speech Regulations on Human Rights Content,” in which YouTube has used machine learning-powered automated flagging to terminate thousands of Syrian YouTube channels that were publishing videos documenting human rights violations.

    How can open source technology contribute to ongoing efforts to archive and safeguard activist content and history? Join us in sharing insights, trying to come up with new ways, tools, and designs to fix this, as an attempt to counter, together, the bleak yet possible scenario of an erasing of activist histories. This panel will discuss specific examples of censored content and how open source archiving technologies can help create useful records for critical events relevant to human rights violations.

    This session aims to ignite a conversation and mobilize the RightsCon community around the topic of corporate social media platforms becoming the de facto recordkeepers of activists’ history while there is still a lack of transparency regarding Big Tech’s content moderation policies. Strengthening the community network by sharing how open source technology can help safeguard activist content history.

    Speakers include:

    - __Dr. Dima Saber__,  Research in Media and Cultural Studies Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural, Birmingham City University
    - __Natalie Cadranel__, Founder and Director, Open Archive
    - __Friedhelm Weinberg__, Executive Director of HURIDOCS
    - __Iván Martínez__, Advocacy Officer,  R3D: Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales

    Organizer and moderator: __Isabella Barroso__, Program Manager at Meedan

  description: While fake news threatens our democracy, fake health news threatens
    our lives.
  long_description: "While fake news threatens our democracy, fake health news threatens
    our lives. From vaccines and infectious viruses to cancer drugs and diets, there
    are thousands of pieces of health misinformation on the internet. While some may
    only result in a little confusion, others have serious and troubling effects.
    \ Increasingly, medical misinformation is seen as a human rights issue because
    the spread of misinformation about health and disease prevention, such as false
    information on risks associated with vaccines, or cancer cure, may deter people
    from taking timely healthcare decisions that protect their health, putting them
    at great risk.   \n\nToday, medical misinformation aided and abetted by social
    media is a growing problem that is harming public health and putting millions
    of people at risk of having their basic rights to health violated and limited.
    Misinformation misleads, reinforces discrimination, facilitates stigma associated
    with mental health and undermines human dignity. Join us for a masterclass workshop
    on how to identify and debunk medical misinformation, false claims, hoaxes and
    outright lies. The session will share experience from fact-checking initiatives
    and global health misinformation researchers from Full Fact, DataLEADS, the University
    of Lagos, and PesaCheck.   \n\nWe’ll integrate insights from health fact-checking
    research conducted by Meedan’s Digital Health Lab, a public health research unit
    working at the intersection of access to health and access to information. We’ll
    review findings that prioritize audience safety and privacy and the importance
    of applying public health standards of care to health communications. The masterclass
    will also share examples of how freedom of information laws can enhance evidence-based
    health reporting and fact-checking. \n\n\n__Nat Gyenes__\nDirector, Digital Health

    of Virtual SwitchPoint Exchanges: online, creative, and highly interactive gatherings
    in the style of SwitchPoint.\n\nMeedan's Nat Gyenes, in collaboration with sexual
    and reproductive health specialist Dr. Mariam Abdou will be discussing gendered
    health misinformation challenges and responses with an interactive exercise.  \n\nThroughout
    this Switchpoint 2020 Reimagined, Youth Voices: The Future We Want will amplify
    the voices of young global health leaders, including members of The Global Fund
    Youth Council, IntraHealth’s Family Planning Youth Ambassador team, young advocacy
    and policy leaders, and extraordinary artists such as CJ Suitt, Culture Mill,
    and Kenyan acclaimed musical artist Juliani. The Global Fund CEO Peter Sands,
    IntraHealth International CEO Polly Dunford, and global specialists will join
    us as we focus on critical global health needs even as countries respond to the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Registration is free and open, though attendance will be capped

    Memes to Movements author An Xiao Mina about her new book, published by Tiller
    Press.
  long_description: |-
    Don’t read the comments. Old advice, yet more relevant than ever. The tools we once hailed for their power to connect people and spark creativity can also be hotbeds of hate, harassment, and political division. Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are under fire for either too much or too little moderation. Creating and maintaining healthy online communities isn’t easy.

    Over the course of two years of graduate research at MIT, former tech journalist and current product manager Anika Gupta interviewed moderators who’d worked on the sidelines of gamer forums and in the quagmires of online news comments sections. She’s spoken with professional and volunteer moderators for communities like Pantsuit Nation, Nextdoor, World of Warcraft guilds, Reddit, and FetLife.

    [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) is the perfect book for anyone looking to take their small community group to the next level, start a career in online moderation, or tackle their own business’s comments section.

    Join [How to Handle a Crowd](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-handle-a-crowd-the-art-of-creating-healthy-and-dynamic-online-communities/9781982132316) author Anika Gupta in conversation with [Memes to Movements](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567159/memes-to-movements-by-an-xiao-mina/) author An Xiao Mina about her new book, published by Tiller Press.

    ### About the Author
    Anika Gupta is a digital thought leader whose research on online communities spans several industries. A former science and technology journalist, she's currently a senior product manager at The Atlantic. In 2019, she was honored as a member of the Online News Association's Women's Leadership Accelerator, a program that finds and trains women media leaders for roles as leaders in the industry. She has a Master's degree in comparative media studies from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor's degree in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.

  description: 'A Check Global Network Event: Join us as we bring together 3 independent
    media organisations ensuring accessibility and diversity in their newsrooms while
    working in challenging regional contexts.'
  long_description: "Only when the cost of access to information is minimal in a country
    can it give way to diverse and vibrant voices of the citizenry. Yet, in many parts
    of the world, structural inequalities, opaque rules, lack of infrastructure and
    resistance from authorities stand in the way. To understand this systemic failure,
    it is important to break it down to a few key questions: Who seeks information?
    Who is denied information? Which information is hidden or does not exist? How
    costly and easy is the access?\n\nAs we observe the [International Day for Universal
    Access to Information](https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/accesstoinformationday)
    on September 28, it is important to acknowledge and learn from those who address
    these questions on a daily basis. To mark this day, Meedan is hosting an online
    event that brings together three innovative and independent newsrooms that are
    led by women, are editorially independent and are uncovering stories of public
    interest and importance in the emerging economies of Brazil, Egypt and India.\n\nThe
    ability to scrutinise, hold power to account and provide a platform for debate
    are roles that a free press and independent media can perform. Yet, governments
    in several countries are stifling criticism by attacking independent media organisations.
    These entities and media persons associated with them are at constant risk of
    being persecuted for their reporting, harassed for holding power to account and
    being starved of financial support. \n\nIn this context, we take a look at how
    [Al-Manassa](https://almanassa.com/en) (Egypt), [Fiquem Sabendo](https://fiquemsabendo.com.br/)
    (Brazil) and [Khabar Lahariya](https://khabarlahariya.org/) (India), three independent
    media organisations are able to:\n- ensure independence, plurality and diversity
    in their newsrooms while working in regions and contexts that are challenging\n-
    build trust with audiences and innovate constantly\n- provide access to information
    for hard to reach communities\n- bring a feminist voice and perspective to media
    content \n\nJoin us in a conversation with the women who lead these organisations
    — Nora Younis, Maria Vitoria Ramos and Disha Mullick — on September 28, 2020.
    \n\n### About the Speakers \n__Disha Mullick__ is the CEO of [Chambal Media](https://chambalmedia.com/),
    a company that produces media for rural audiences, with a unique rural feminist
    voice. Chambal Media runs the iconic news brand, Khabar Lahariya, where women
    from remote villages of north India are trained to be professional journalists
    and produce local news in their languages, from their unique perspective. \n\n__Maria
    Vitória Ramos__ is the co-founder and CEO of Fiquem Sabendo, a media startup in
    Brazil keeping the powerful accountable. She was a reporter for Ponte Jornalismo,
    exposing violations of Human Rights by the police and armed forces in Brazil and
    is the author of \"Indigentes: the State that buries without warning\", an investigative
    book that exposes the heartbreaking system that keeps families looking for supposedly
    missing people for years when they have been buried by the Brazilian government.\n\n__Nora
    Younis__ is the founder and chief editor of Al-Manassa, a news outlet in Egypt.
    A rights advocate and journalist, Younis has also worked as managing editor at
    Al-Masry Al-Youm, a popular news daily in Egypt. Recently Younis was at the receiving
    end of the government clamping down on news organizations and was detained in
    the name of running a news website without an operating license. \n\nThis event
    is part of the Check Global Network’s series ‘Women, Media and the Pandemic’.
    Launched on May 5, 2020, Check Global Network members are currently located in
    the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, Kenya, Zimbabwe
    and Mexico. As a community of independent media, technology and human rights groups,
    the Check Global Network plans to meet regularly to discuss solutions to challenges,
    to design collaborative projects and to respond proactively to the needs of partners
    in emerging economies.\n\nFor more information about joining the network, please

  long_description: |-
    How US fact-checkers are covering COVID-19, protests, fires — and an election

    2020 has been a very busy year for fact-checkers — especially in the United States. Since January, PolitiFact has fact-checked about 600 claims about the coronavirus, most of them false or misleading, while also covering the presidential election and protests against police brutality. From live convention coverage to swatting down viral hoaxes about wildfires, this session will discuss how fact-checkers can juggle multiple major news stories at once and promote the truth on the internet.

    Daniel Funke is a staff writer covering online misinformation for PolitiFact. He previously reported for Poynter as a fact-checking reporter and a Google News Lab Fellow, and has worked for the Los Angeles Times, USA Today and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

    on October 5, 2020.  It’s called *COVID-19 Local News Forum: What does the second
    wave of COVID-19 reporting look like?*\n\n[Dr. Seema Yasmin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/seema-yasmin)
    will facilitate a town-hall style forum between Meedan’s in-house team of scientists
    and a variety of local news outlets across the United States. \n\nWith the first
    nine months of the pandemic behind us, and in anticipation of a second wave this
    fall, we are aiming for this discussion to serve as an opportunity to reflect
    on how local news reporting fared during the early stages of this global crisis.
    We’ll also work together to design new paths forward for scientists and journalists
    as reporting needs increase around emerging treatments, vaccines and projected
    upticks in transmission.\n\nOur panelists include: \n\n- Anna Kuchment, science
    reporter at Dallas Morning News and contributing editor at Scientific American
    \n\n- Jiquanda Johnson, founder and publisher of Flint Beat and Brown Impact\n\n-
    Dr. Christin Gilmer, global health expert and science lead of learnaboutcovid19.org
    \n\n- Dr. Jessica Huang, COVID-19 response and recovery fellow, Harvard Kennedy
    School, and health literacy researcher for learnaboutcovid19.org \n\nThe event
    is scheduled for Monday October 5 from 12:30-2 PM ET (9:30-11AM PT)."
