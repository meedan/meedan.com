    The Fellow’s research will include analysis of large, real-world social media
    datasets created and annotated by Meedan partners. This opportunity is available
    to suitable candidates located anywhere in the world to work remotely with in-person
    opportunities in Oxford, UK, or San Francisco, USA.\n\nMeedan is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
    that builds digital tools for global journalism. We are a team of designers, technologists,
    academics, and journalists who focus on open source investigation of digital media
    and crowdsourced translation of social media. With commercial, media and university
    partners, we support research, curriculum development, and new forms of digital

    (Rappler, Vera Files), Africa (AfricaCheck, PesaCheck) and for world changing
    human rights investigations with partners like Bellingcat, Syrian Archives, Watching

    Check, an open-source media annotation web application integrated with major social
    media platforms that allows journalists, human-rights defenders, and civil society
    organizations to annotate, verify, fact-check, and contextualize web content in
    a collaborative manner mixing human and machine intelligence.\n\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n####
    Original Research\n\n- Develop and undertake state-of-the-art research in social
    data science, computational social science, or computer science.\n- Lead quantitative
    analysis of large social-media datasets, including messaging app data already
    collected for the project from tip lines operated by media partners and webscraping.\n-
    Survey existing literature, tools, and techniques in regard to messaging platforms
    and online communication.\n- Writing, publication, and dissemination of results
    in articles, blog posts, and project reports aimed at both academic and non-academic
    audiences.\n\n#### Project Administration\n\n- General day-to-day administration
    of the project and coordination with all project partners.\n- Research design
    in collaboration with the lead investigators.\n- Maintaining the project’s online
    presence.\n- Support legal partners working to develop and evaluate new data governance
    approaches.\n\n#### Research Support\n\n- Participate actively in the intellectual
    life of Meedan sharing findings and developing research questions with Meedan’s
    program, product, design, and software development teams.\n- Such other project-related
    duties as may be required by Dr Scott Hale.\n\n### Qualifications\n\n#### Required\n\n-
    Hold a relevant Ph.D in computational social science, computer science, communication
    or another programme with social science theory and computational/data science
    methods. Those without a Ph.D. but with exceptional academic research experience
    will also be considered.\n- Demonstrated experience in empirical data analysis
    using a suitable scripting language (e.g., Python)\n- Ability to effectively disseminate
    results to a range of stakeholders\n- Ability to work flexibly, prioritizing tasks
    to meet given deadlines and maintaining a high standard of accuracy and attention
    to detail\n- Interpersonal skills relevant to working with colleagues as part
    of a global, cross-cultural team at Meedan and communicating across disciplines
    and industry-academia boundaries\n- The ability to write reports and publications
    in fluent English\n\n#### Optional, but a plus\n\n- Machine learning, natural
    language processing, crowdsourcing, image/video processing (e.g., image hashing),
    or computer vision experience \n- Strong experience in Computer-Supported Collaborative
    Work, Computer Mediated Communication, and other disciplines focused on analysing
    online communication. \n- Demonstrated commitment to Open Science and public or
    policy engagement\n\n\n### About the CryptoChat project\n\nThe CryptoChat project
    is a 12-month quantitative research project analysing communication dynamics in
    large datasets from encrypted messaging platforms. It leverages existing datasets
    in a comparative analysis to understand how encrypted messaging differs from the
    open web and other social media platforms. The intended contributions of this
    research are multifold. \n\n1. Provide insights into the nature of encrypted messaging
    platforms through descriptive statistics about their use (e.g., number of users,
    number of unique messages, number of images versus textual messages, temporal
    trends). \n2. Provide exploratory analysis of the data through unsupervised methods
    such as clustering images based on similarity metrics and topic modeling text
    to generate hypotheses for further research.\n3. Investigate instances of dangerous
    and harmful content within the datasets with a specific focus on hate speech and
    incitement to violence.\n4. Provide methodological insights into how to best study
    mis/disinformation on encrypted platforms, with considerations for both ethics
    and efficacy. Specifically, we compare datasets created through misinformation
    tiplines with datasets created by crawling the web for join links to large, pseudo-public
    groups.\n5. Compare content in our closed messaging datasets to open web and traditional
    media data to understand the extent to which content overlaps and the temporal
    ordering of content appearance. Does content appear first on closed messaging
    platforms and later on the open web or vice versa?\n6. Build the technical capacity
    to generate descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis quickly. We will build
    interfaces for live statistics with the goal of allowing policymakers, journalists,
    and the public to understand the content submitted in near real-time. We will
    further build a robust pipeline for exploratory data analysis (e.g., content clustering)
    so that reports with these results can be published within one month of any tip
    line deployment.\n7. Build and test a legal and ethical framework that provides
    clear guidelines for data collection and data usage in a global context.\n\nMeedan
    is a fast-paced, small, software development startup that relies heavily on the
    unique skills of each team member. Our team members are able to work flexibly
    and respond to challenges across a range of project areas. We are headquartered
    in San Francisco’s SOMA district with team members distributed through multiple
    cities and time zones. We encourage individuals from historically underrepresented
    communities in technology and journalism to apply, including women, people of
    color, people with disabilities and those who identify as LGBTQ.\n\nSalary and
    benefits commensurate with qualifications and experience. \n\nPlease send CV and
