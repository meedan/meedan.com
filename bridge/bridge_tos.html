<h3>Welcome to Meedan!</h3>

<p>Check, Bridge and Montage are web applications developed by Meedan, Inc. (“Meedan”), a San Francisco-based 501 c3 nonprofit international media and open source technology do-tank, and Meedan Labs, Inc., brought together under Meedan’s open source code. Our goal in developing Check, Bridge and Montage was to make the world a better, more cross-lingual, cross-cultural, and informed place. Really. We hope these Terms of Service (the “TOS” or “Terms”) reflect our commitment to these values. Through the Terms, we want to inform you of your legal obligations as a user and our legal obligations to you as the company that has designed and deployed this software. At its core, Meedan is a project founded on the values of collaboration and open source approaches to content and code development.</p>

<p>The Services do not include any third-party software, application, widget, or integration used in concert with Bridge. An example of such might be Slack. Any such third-party technologies have their own terms of service. The Terms only apply to our Services.</p>
