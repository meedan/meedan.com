<h3>A. Approved Usage</h3>

<p>You can use Check Message by sending or forwarding us a message (an image, a link, a meme, and/or text) and confirming that you desire us to verify, investigate, fact-check, or otherwise respond to the information. Only upon receipt of such a message and subsequent confirmation of a request for investigation shall we respond with our findings and, if generated, a  Check Message Report (“Report”) which may indicate a machine or human generated status and contain information we, our partners, and/or our automated systems determine to be relevant. We do not use Check Message to send out any unsolicited links or information whatsoever.</p>

<p>By submitting any query to Check Message, you represent and warrant that you are either the owner of such query (“Content”) and/or have the requisite authority of the owner of such Content to submit such Content to Check Message.</p>

<p>By using Check Message, you represent and warrant to us that you are of the legal age and capacity to form a binding contract with us.</p>

<p>You shall not engage in any activities, actions or omissions whatsoever that render your use of Check Message or requisitioning of information illegal. In the event that you use Check Message to communicate any information which we deem in our sole opinion to be illegal or unlawful or punishable under the laws of the United States of America, we shall have the right to relay and disclose such information to any governmental or/and law enforcement authorities.</p>
