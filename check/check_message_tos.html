<p>Thank you for reaching out to Check Message, aka Check for private messaging systems, a service made available to you (“you”, “your”) by Meedan, Inc (“we/us/our/Meedan”). By using this service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).</p>

<h3>A. Approved Usage</h3>

<p>You can use Check Message by sending or forwarding us a message (an image, a link, a meme, and/or text) and confirming that you desire us to verify, investigate, fact-check, or otherwise respond to the information. Only upon receipt of such a message and subsequent confirmation of a request for investigation shall we respond with our findings and, if generated, a  Check Message Report (“Report”) which may indicate a machine or human generated status and contain information we, our partners, and/or our automated systems determine to be relevant. We do not use Check Message to send out any unsolicited links or information whatsoever.</p>

<p>By submitting any query to Check Message, you represent and warrant that you are either the owner of such query (“Content”) and/or have the requisite authority of the owner of such Content to submit such Content to Check Message.</p>

<p>By using Check Message, you represent and warrant to us that you are of the legal age and capacity to form a binding contract with us.</p>

<p>You shall not engage in any activities, actions or omissions whatsoever that render your use of Check Message or requisitioning of information illegal. In the event that you use Check Message to communicate any information which we deem in our sole opinion to be illegal or unlawful or punishable under the laws of the United States of America, we shall have the right to relay and disclose such information to any governmental or/and law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>You agree that your use of Check Message shall be at your sole risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Meedan, its officers, directors, employees, partners, and agents disclaim all warranties, express or implied, in connection with Check Message and your use of the service.</p>

<p>Consistent with this, Meedan makes no warranties or representations about the accuracy or completeness of the Reports or the content of any third-party content linked to the reports.

Your use of such third-party information shall be subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of these third-parties.

We neither endorse nor are we responsible for any information shared by any third-parties, including third-party links included in the Report, and for the consequences of such sharing or posting.</p>
